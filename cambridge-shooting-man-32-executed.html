He won the case."</p><p>Another pal added: "This act is just beyond evil, it's premeditated and disgusting.</p><p>"Josh won custody of his son. Josh absolutely doted on him. He was his entire world.</p><p>"But what should have been the best day of his life ended up being his last, the day he was killed. It's just horrendous."</p><h2>'HE WAS DOING REALLY WELL IN LIFE'</h2><p>Josh split with the child's mum, a <a href=#>nurse</a>, some time after the boy was born in 2015.</p><p>She remarried a USAF <a href=#>airman</a> and was planning to move to the US with him and the child if she won the custody case.</p><p>Josh's friend said: "They were together a good few years but split a while ago. I didn't know her new boyfriend but believe he used to be in the army."</p><p>"Josh had his own building firm and a lovely house. He was doing really well in life. He had loads of friends and everyone is completely broken.</p><p>"He was genuinely the nicest guy you could meet. On nights out he would leave with people to make sure they got home safe.</p><p>"If he saw someone struggling with their bags, he'd help. I know it's always said when someone loses their life, but in Josh's case it's true.</p><p>"You couldn't meet a better person. No one deserves to die like this, but in Josh's case it's especially true.</p><p>"It's such a tragedy. Josh and his son were devoted to each other.</p><p>"Josh was incredible with his son. And now he won't be there for him. And neither will his grandad. There are just no words for how appalling it is."</p><p>Friend to Joshua, Demi-Rae Jenny, wrote on <a href=#>Facebook</a>: "Going to miss you, you were an amazing person and dad and I cannot believe it.</p><p>"I love you always Josh and will always remember our laughs and jokes and cherish our memories and friendship forever. Sleep well, Josh."</p><h2>DEVOTED DAD</h2><p>Joshua ran his own business, J Dunmore Building Services, having previously owned a building business with his dad Gary for a number of years.</p><p>He had studied at Cambridge Regional College and was devoted to his toddler son, who has not been named.</p><p>Samantha Impey, 51, has been a <a href=#>neighbour</a> of Gary's for almost a decade.</p><p>She said she was "shocked" by his passing and would often see him working on his rented property, a semi-detached Â£200k house, or say hello when she was out walking her Springer Spaniel, Ruby.</p><p>The 51-year-old IT worker described Gary as "tall with grey hair".</p><p>A floral tribute to Gary, left outside his home, said: "To my dear neighbour Gary.</p><p>"A man who loved his family dearly, a dear friend to all, so helpful and kind and was always around as a friend and my little odd job man.</p><p>"I'm going to miss you."</p><p>A further tribute said: "RIP Gary. Absolutely gutted."</p><p>In an emotional tribute, self-proclaimed best friend to Joshua, Adam Dutch Cross, wrote: "Can't believe it, rest in peace bro!!</p><p>"Another good one taken well too soon. Going to miss you my G- a proper decent bloke and best friends for years.</p><p>"Absolute insanity, I'm still in shock- always will be to be fair."</p><p>One of the floral tributes left in Bluntisham said: "Josh, you shined such a bright light over everyone around you.</p><p>"It was impossible not to smile when you're around.</p><p>"You're going to be missed so much."</p><h2>'YOU WILL BE DEARLY MISSED'</h2><p>Another note left on flowers outside the police cordon around Josh's house wrote: "Rest easy Josh. Your son was a very lucky boy to have a dad like you.</p><p>"Your bubbly personality will be dearly missed."</p><p>A third wrote: "Josh, you shined such a bright light over everyone around you.</p><p>"It was impossible not to smile when you're around. You're going to be missed so much."</p><p>Another pal, Harli, left a heartfelt note: âTo Josh.&nbsp;I cannot believe I am writing this. This week was meant to be a celebration for you and your precious boy.</p><p>âI pray that you can rest in peace knowing you fought every day for your son. Everything you done was for him and he will forever know this.</p><p>"I will remember to pick up my smile like you always told me when I had a resting b***h face in the gym.</p><p>âSIBA will never be the same without&nbsp;you and your witty ways. Keep on grooving up their rude boi. Love Harli.â</p><h2>'THEN I SAW THE ARMED POLICE'</h2><p>Police officers were yesterday seen removing Josh's body from the scene of his killing.</p><p>Witness Gordon Murray, 62, said he watched as cop cars raced to the scene of Gary's fatal shooting.</p><p>He said: "I thought it was an altercation or something. Then I saw the armed police.</p><p>"They were shouting something to the homeowners. That was it."</p><p>He said officers asked for CCTV footage and when he checked it he saw a white car pass twice.</p><p>On the second pass the car stopped and someone opened the boot.</p><p>Support engineer Gordon added: "My son said he heard some bangs but I don't know if that was the car doors slamming.</p><p>"There was a white hatchback which came around and stopped outside then half an hour later he came back and lifted up the boot."</p><p>Det Chief Supt Jon Hutchinson, of Cambridgeshire Police, yesterday confirmed the two men shot dead were "father and son".</p><p>He said the "primary line of investigation" was related to a "familial issue".</p><p><strong>Do YOU know anything about this story? Get in touch: emer.scully@thesun.co.uk</strong></p><p>Mr Hutchinson added: "It's been widely reported in the media that this may relate to a custody battle.</p><p>"I can confirm that is an active line of inquiry for us."</p><p>He said officers made a "very quick two arrests in a hotel just outside Cambridge".</p><p>Mr Hutchinson added: "In the early hours of this morning we did a joint operation alongside West Mercia Police at which stage a 66-year-old man was arrested on the motorway by armed officers.</p><p>"Following his arrest his vehicle was searched and I can confirm we have recovered a firearm."</p><p>He added "at this stage we're not looking for any further people in relation" to the killings.</p><p>Mr Hutchinson said: "A line of inquiry we're focusing on is that those people who are in custody are known to the deceased and have had recent contact with them."</p><p>He said forensic work was taking place to establish if the same weapon was used at both locations.</p><p>My son said he heard some bangs but I don't know if that was the car doors slamming</p><span class=quote-credit>Neighbour Gordon</span><p>A spokesman added: "The three people arrested in connection with this case remain in custody today.</p><p>"Formal identification of the victims has not been completed so we are not in a position to release further information on them.</p><p>"Post-mortem examinations are due to be carried out by Dr Ben Swift at Peterborough City Hospital on Monday, April 3."</p><p>A spokesperson from the "sleepy" village Bluntisham Parish Council said: "We are deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the tragic incident which unfolded in our village last night.</p><p>"Our thoughts and condolences are with the loved ones of the victims of this horrific crime which has rocked our community.</p><p>"We appreciate the work of the first responders in dealing with this incident.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"We ask the public to respect the privacy of the families and neighbours in our village affected by this upsetting event during this difficult time.</p><p>"We'd also like to extend our sympathies to our neighbours in nearby Sutton, who will be feeling the same shock and sorrow following such an awful event affecting our two villages."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bluntisham-cambridgeshire-floral-tributes-left-806589197.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bluntisham-cambridgeshire-floral-tributes-left-806589189.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ac-murder-bluntisham-map-v3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cops-probe-possible-link-custody-806637091.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cops-probe-possible-link-custody-806627269.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ355hZJxb3Fnk5a6o77InZ6eZaOdvLDAyKeeZqWRo3p0foyer56bpamypXs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fedor-andreev.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fedor Andreev Biography">&larr;
