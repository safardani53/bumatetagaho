Additionally, he doesn’t have a wife and is the son of parents Tom and April Collins.</strong></p><p>The recently released free agent is topping the internet trends, with <a href=#>NFL</a> fans curious about his personal life, family, wife, and children.&nbsp;</p><p>The hardworking and talented Collins has faced many challenges in his career and has often been part of controversial news and incidents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Landon-In-Giants-Outfit.png><p>Landon Collins was born on January 10, 1994, in Louisiana, United States. Sports was a part of his life from an early age, evidenced by his participation in track and football at Dutchtown High School.</p><p>ESPN also ranked Collins the top safety in its 2012 ranking of the top 150 high school football players but No.6 overall.</p><p>The highly recruited prospect ultimately committed to Alabama. By all statistics, he had a successful college football career.&nbsp;</p><p>Commencing that, the New York Giants selected him in the second round of the 2015 NFL Draft. He has also featured for the Washington Football Team in the professional league.</p><p>Collins’ career is at a crossroads at the moment because he is still looking for a new offer as a free agent. In terms of his personal life, he shares key moments on his Instagram (<a href=# rel=noopener>@thehumble_21</a>). He posts pictures of his kids and his football life.</p><h2>Landon Collins Children And Wife</h2><p>People are interested in how many children the linebacker has. This is because his ex-girlfriend accused him of impregnating three women at once back in 2016.</p><p>Collins has not stated anything regarding the accusations. However, on his Instagram, he shares stories about his daughter and two sons. The identity of his children’s mothers remains a mystery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Landon-And-His-Child.jpg><p>In terms of his marital life and wife, we can report that he is unmarried.&nbsp;</p><p>By all indications, he is presently in a relationship with fellow Alabama graduate Victoria Lowery. They have been dating since their University days.</p><h2>Landon Collins Family</h2><p>Football was in Landon’s family from age 4, as his dad, Tom, coached him in his early years. Landon famously labeled him “the most influential coach I’ve ever had.”</p><p>Tom presently works as a station director at the Coastal Bridge Construction Company in Louisiana. Tom gave his son the nickname “money” because everything he would do turned into gold at the age of six.</p><p>On the other hand, Landon’s relationship with his mother, April, has not been sailing so smoothly. They had a rift when Landon chose to play collegiate football for Alabama instead of LSU.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Landon-Collins-And-Mother-April-Justin.jpg><p>April believed joining LSU would be more beneficial to Landon as he would get more game-time, and the offer was financially more lucrative.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of siblings, Landon has a sister, Gerrah, and two brothers, Gerald and Justin. Gerald was a college basketball phenom and played for the Baltimore Ravens in the NFL.&nbsp;</p><p>April and Landon’s relationship has slowly but surely improved over the years after the LSU-Alabama fiasco. The pair try to avoid questions regarding the situation, and there is still a fair bit of tension regarding the matter.</p><p>“I just want to make this clear: I’m not an LSU fan. But I stick to my guns that he could have accomplished more individually at LSU,” April stated in an interview in 2020 not letting of her stance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC4wKebqKZdmLytuMinqmabmJ65pb7Ep2Shp6diuqK62GaiopyjYrGwsdJmn55lmJbDpnnWop2eZZaWuqq42Gg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lucille-ball-grandchildren.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lucille Ball's Grandchildren Followed in Her Creative Footsteps">&larr;
