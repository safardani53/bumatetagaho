I was his first serious girlfriend and thought he was willing to settle down.&nbsp;</p><p>“Instead he proved me wrong in the cruellest way imaginable while we should have been celebrating our anniversary.”</p><p>Abi and Harry got together when she was 19. She says pals warned her off Harry - who she’d known since their school days where he was in the year below her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000641108307.jpg><p>“He always had girls, but he was never in a relationship,” Abi says.</p><p>“Even his friends would warn me: ‘You don’t know what you’re getting into.’ But I was blindly in love.”</p><p>In spring 2019, the couple began discussing plans to celebrate their first year together.</p><p>By June, they had booked a 10-day trip to Gran Canaria after popping into a travel agent's.</p><p>It did impact on our sex life because I felt so ill, but I never in a million years thought he’d go looking elsewhere for it, especially while we were on holiday together</p><span class=quote-credit>Abi Willis</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>20</span><p>Abi says: “We only went in to have a quick look, but ended up ringing my parents to lend us the £1,200 to book a trip.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’d been abroad with girlfriends before, but Harry had never been on a lads’ holiday.&nbsp;</p><p>“In preparation, we did loads of shopping together. I had my eyelashes and nails done, and picked out some new bikinis.</p><p>“I was envisioning romantic meals, lazy days by the pool and maybe a couple of nights having one too many drinks.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/d2d7de07-62c6-46fa-827f-4d8d337b135d.jpg><p>In September 2019, the pair jetted off on holiday and checked in to the swish Ocean Hill Hotel in Puerto Rico de Gran Canaria.</p><p>“It was a gorgeous place,” says Abi. “Very modern and minimalist, decorated in white, creams and pale blues. There were three pools, a bar and restaurant. It was perfect.”</p><p>On their second night on the island, the pair got chatting with a Brit called Susie*&nbsp;and her friend after a chance encounter in a bar.&nbsp;</p><p>I crashed out about 11pm. All my friends know me as a famously heavy sleeper - I slept right through until the next morning when I woke with Harry beside me, asking how I was feeling</p><span class=quote-credit>Abi Willis</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>21</span><p>“They overheard Harry saying he’d run out of cigarettes and offered him one,” explains Abi.</p><p>“We ended up sitting together and having drinks. They were a good laugh, just having fun on their first holiday together.</p><p>“I remember Harry had a bit too much to drink. There was an odd moment where he went to the loo and Susie suddenly got up to go, too.&nbsp;</p><p>“They walked out of the loo together moments later. I felt there was something not quite right, but I pushed it to the back of my mind.&nbsp;</p><p>“Susie was younger than us, I just couldn’t see Harry being interested in her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000641108305.jpg><p>The four swapped Snapchats and phone numbers so they could keep in touch and arrange another night of partying.</p><p>But in the meantime, Abi overdid it working on her tan, and ended up with sunstroke.&nbsp;</p><p>“I really wasn’t very well,” she recalls. “My nose was blistered and my cheeks and chest were bright red.&nbsp;</p><p>“There was one point when we went shopping when I actually passed out in the mall.&nbsp;</p><p>“Harry was really good about it, getting me water and sitting in the shade with me.</p><p>“In the evenings, I was probably pushing myself harder than I should have to go out and have fun, because I was conscious of the fact it was Harry’s holiday too and I didn’t want to spoil it.</p><p>“It did impact on our sex life because I felt so ill, but I never in a million years thought he’d go looking elsewhere for it, especially while we were on holiday together.”</p><p>I was physically sick. I couldn’t imagine the mindset of someone who gets into bed with his girlfriend, then leaves her alone in a hotel room and sneaks out to have sex with someone else while she’s asleep</p><span class=quote-credit>Abi Willis</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>21</span><p>On their third-to-last night, Abi recalls seeing Susie and her friend sat outside a local bar.</p><p>“I looked at her to smile ‘hello’ and she just looked away,” says Abi.&nbsp;</p><p>“I said to Harry ‘what’s that all about?’, but he just shrugged as if to say ‘no idea’.</p><p>“It got to our second-to-last night and we were out having drinks with a lovely couple we’d met earlier in the week.</p><p>“We’d been for meals and on trips with them. I wasn’t feeling the best and was sticking to soft drinks. In the end I had to cut the night short as I was feeling so rough.&nbsp;</p><p>“Harry came back to the apartment with me and we both got in bed together.&nbsp;</p><p>“I crashed out about 11pm. All my friends know me as a famously heavy sleeper - I slept right through until the next morning when I woke with Harry beside me, asking how I was feeling.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/f961cfaf-4dc3-48e5-944d-a3f0246fea31.jpg><p>On their final night in Gran Canaria, Abi and Harry encountered Susie and her pal in a bar - but Abi says the pair initially blanked them.</p><p>“I looked over and they turned away,” she says.</p><p>“I told Harry I thought it was really odd, but he made out that I was being paranoid. My stomach was in knots, I could just feel something was off.</p><p>“In the end, I went over to them, made a point of saying hello and offered to get the drinks in as it was our last night.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was a really odd atmosphere and at one point I remember Susie asking Harry if he’d ever go on a lads’ holiday.&nbsp;</p><p>“Harry replied that he didn’t need to while he was with me.&nbsp;</p><p>“Then Susie said to him, really cattily: ‘Isn’t it true that what happens on holiday stays on holiday?’</p><p>“It was such an odd thing to say - like she was trying her hardest to get between us.</p><p>“In the end, I drank my way through it and pushed my fears away again.”</p><p>The couple flew home the following day. Three months later, they split following a row on Abi’s brother’s 18th birthday.</p><p>Abi says: “My little brother Alec absolutely worshipped Harry but the day came for his 18th and Harry hadn’t even bothered getting him a card.</p><p>“We ended up arguing and by then I’d had enough, so I asked him to leave. He kept saying he loved me but I insisted it was over.”</p><p>Eight days later, Susie messaged Abi out of the blue on Snapchat.</p><p>Her message read: “I f**ked Harry on holiday” followed by the crying with laughter emoji.</p><p>As a kicker, Susie had added the word “twice” and sent a photo of herself with Harry.</p><p>Abi explains: “She said he’d gone to her hotel while I was in bed and they’d had sex.&nbsp;</p><p>“She thought it was time I knew, in case Harry was still my boyfriend. The fact that he wasn’t didn’t make me feel any better.</p><p>“I was physically sick. I couldn’t imagine the mindset of someone who gets into bed with his girlfriend, then leaves her alone in a hotel room and sneaks out to have sex with someone else while she’s asleep.</p><p>“It was so malicious and calculated.&nbsp;And the very next night we’d all been sat having drinks together as though nothing had happened - I was the only one there who didn’t know.</p><p>“I felt like our whole relationship had been a lie.&nbsp;</p><p>“I called Harry and he tried denying it at first, but in the end he said ‘yeah, I f**ked her’, and hung up the phone."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Harry's response</h3></p><p>In response, Harry admitted cheating on Abi.</p><p>He says: "I did regret it yeah, of course I did. But then I found out she cheated on me before the holiday too.</p><p>"I don’t really want to have an input. I've already apologised to her."</p><p>Abi denies cheating on Harry. He was given the chance to provide proof of her cheating, but declined.</p><p>Abi says her mental health has suffered as a result of her experience, and the thought of travelling abroad - even with girlfriends - makes her anxious.</p><p>“It’s made me question who I can trust,” she says. “If someone who I was so close to could be so hurtful, who else could hurt me?</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>“I’ve been left wondering 'why wasn’t our relationship good enough?
