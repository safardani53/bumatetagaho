People dream of having their hobby as a career. How better would it be when your hobby becomes a career?</p><p>Thus, the Nebraskan racer enjoys every moment of racing.</p><p>Brian set out to live his dream at 17. By the time he was 18, the American had established himself as a professional for Team Moto XXX.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brian-Deegan-Driving-At-The-Rallycross-X-Games.jpg><p>At the same time, Deegan became the youngest and the first pro rider to land a 360 Mulisha Twist at the X Games.</p><p>But before becoming the first-ever professional to do a 360 at the Winter Games, a harsh reality check was in store for the motocross rider as Deegan broke both his femur and wrists.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, the highlight of Brian’s career was ghosting his way to the finish line at the L.A. Coliseum in 1997.</p><p>Placing fourth in the 2004 Summer X Games, a sudden urge rose in the rider to divert to driving as someone once said: “Failure is only a detour to success.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Way To Success</h3><p>In 2009, Brian started off-road racing for Unlimited Lites Division, beating out several pros.</p><p>Deegan stood second at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum in the Rally Car Racing event behind <a href=# rel=noopener>Tanner Foust</a>.</p><p>Similarly, in a Rally Car, Super Rally, the motocross rider finished second again after failing to beat Tanner Foust.</p><p>Nonetheless, second place was not the only spot for Brian as he celebrated a comfortable first-place finish at the Crandon International Off-Road Raceway, taking home the World Championship title in the Traxxas TORC Series held the event in 2011.</p><p>The Nebraskan won in the Pro Lite Unlimited and Pro 2 divisions at the Lucas Oil Off-Road Racing Series.</p><p>Brian undertook the task of driving a Metal Mulisha Monster Truck.
