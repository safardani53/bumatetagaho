Frankie was the surprise musical guest during the Miss America pageant’s finals evening on December 15, 2022. In front of 51 participants, he sang three of his own compositions, including Dripping in Love, his new single.&nbsp;His performance had the crowd cheering and shouting for him on stage. Frankie started singing in school and launched his career when he joined the boyband WOW.</p><h2>Frankie Zulferino, a surprise musical guest at Miss America 2023, composed his first song when he was 21 years old.</h2><p>Zulferino grew raised on New York’s Staten Island. His father is a firefighter, while his mother is a nurse. Frankie was often teased at school because of his love of dancing and because he was “chubby.” He attempted a lot of musical auditions to obtain a head start in the music business, but he was often turned down. Frankie went solo after his initial performance with the boyband WOW and multiple tours around Europe and Canada. I Found You, his debut song, was written when he was 21 years old. He has worked with a number of agents, producers, and managers throughout the years, including Johnny Wright and Eif Rivera. Frankie also tried out for The NEXT and The X Factor and made it through numerous rounds on both programs.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Frankie-Zulferino-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Joe Jonas coached Frankie on The NEXT, which he describes as a “terrific experience.” Zulferino now mentors and teaches numerous kids to sing.
