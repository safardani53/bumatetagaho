Age, Height & Body Measurements</h2><p>Having been born in the year 1952 makes Dave age 67 years at the moment. Although people may say that 67 is a bit old, Wannastedt will not agree with you because he stills works as an analyst for FOX Sports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dave-1-211x300.png><p>Furthermore, the Pennsylvania native stands at 6 feet 3 inches (1.93 meters) tall, which would have been a great advantage during his playing career. But unfortunately, due to injuries, Dave could never use his large frame to make a name for himself as a player.</p><h2>Dave Wannstedt | Career</h2><p>Dave’s professional career started with the Green Bay Packers when he got selected in the 15th round of the 1974 NFL Draft.</p><p>Consequently, things looked bright for the then 22-year-old, but the situation went haywire in no time. To explain, Wannstedt injured his neck in the preseason camp and sadly never played again.</p><p>On the contrary, the Pennsylvania native landed himself a job in the coaching role, a decision that would define his legacy and career.</p><p>After that, he spent the next four years with the Pitt Panthers, where he won the NCAA Division-I national football championship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wannstedt-934.jpg><p>However, his big breakthrough in the coaching line came during the 1989 season when the mighty Dallas Cowboys recruited Dave as their defensive coordinator.</p><p>Under his mentorship, the Cowboys defense was considered one of the best at the time. In fact, the Dallas-based franchise even won the Super Bowl XVIII with Wannstedt as their defensive coordinator.</p><p>By the year 1993, the Pennsylvania native had already earned a reputation for himself as one of the best coaches.</p><p>Therefore, on 19 January 1993, the Chicago Bears decided to hire Dave as their head coach to replace the legendary <strong>Mike Ditka</strong>.</p><h4>Don’t forget to check out:<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;&lt;Eben Britton Bio: Net Worth, Hotboxin, Wife, Height, Salary Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>As soon as Wannstedt took the job, he was under immense pressure to replicate Ditka’s work previously.</p><p>Added to that, this was his first job as a head coach in the NFL, which made things even worse. Consequently, Dave’s six years with the Bears turned out to be a nightmare as the franchise could reach the postseason just once.</p><p>Thus, in 1999, the&nbsp;Chicago Bears fired the 67-year-old due to his underwhelming performances over the course of six years.</p><p>But soon after losing his job, Wannstedt found a new one with the Miami Dolphins. He assumed the role of defensive coordinator along with being the assistant head coach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wannstedt-937.jpg><p>But in a stroke of luck, Dolphins head coach, <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Johnson</strong></a>, suddenly decided to retire, which meant that Dave had to step up to take the head coach’s role. Subsequently, his next five years with the franchise were full of highs and lows.</p><p>To explain, the 67-year-old started his reign exceedingly well as he guided the Dolphins to two consecutive playoff appearances in his first two years.</p><p>But, his next three years with the Miami-based franchise turned into disappointment as Wannstedt’s mistakes piled up one after the other.</p><h4>You might also be interested in:<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;&lt;Erica Enders Bio: Instagram, Net Worth, Movie, Husband, Career Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>As a result, Dolphins fans grew tired of the Pennsylvania native, which ultimately led to his resignation in 2004.</p><p>Thereafter, not even two months had passed since his resignation when Dave got the opportunity to manage his alma mater, the University of Pittsburg.</p><p>Upon arriving, Wannstedt said that managing his former team was one of the proudest moments of his career and that he vowed to win trophies for the team.</p><p lang=qme dir=ltr><a href=#>#girldad</a> <a href=#>#beardown</a> <a href=#>#circa1993</a> ❤️❤️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/VW0acajykK</a></p><p>— Coach Wannstedt (@CoachWannstedt) <a href=#>January 29, 2020</a></p><p>Unfortunately, the Pennsylvania native could not win any award for the university during his six-year-long tenure.</p><p>In fact, the pressure got so immense that Wannstedt decided to resign from the job as he could not deliver on his promises.</p><p>Nonetheless, the university acknowledged his determination by offering him a position as a special assistant to the athletic director. But Dave declined the offer as he needed some time off from footballing activities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wannstedt-936.jpg><p>Having sat out for almost a year, the 67-year-old decided that it was time for him to get back into football.</p><p>And that is what he did as he took the assistant head coach’s role with the Buffalo Bills. But unfortunately, Wannstedt was dismissed along with the entire Bills coaching staff due to their lackluster performances just one year after taking the job.</p><p>Subsequently, the Pennsylvania native joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as their special teams’ coach, but disappointingly like many times before; Dave was let go at the end of the 2013 season.</p><p>The 2013 season also marked an end to Wannstedt’s 20-year-long professional coaching career as he has not taken any role in football since.</p><h3>W<span>here is Dave Wannstedt now | Fox NFL Kickoff</span></h3><p>On the contrary, the 67-year-old has made some appearances as a football analyst for FOX Sports. For instance, Dave regularly appears on FOX NFL Kickoff, which airs every Sunday morning during the NFL season.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Champs Sunday tune in Fox Nfl Kickoff 1ET ⁦<a href=#>@Spoon33</a>⁩ ⁦<a href=#>@PSchrags</a>⁩ ⁦<a href=#>@MichaelVick</a>⁩ ⁦<a href=#>@CharissaT</a>⁩ ⁦<a href=#>@ColinCowherd</a>⁩ ⁦<a href=#>@TonyGonzalez88</a>⁩ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CEbf6ZmDDA</a></p><p>— Coach Wannstedt (@CoachWannstedt) <a href=#>January 24, 2021</a></p><p>Furthermore, Wannstedt recently made an appearance in an episode of&nbsp; Chicago Fire, which is an American action drama sitcom.</p><h2>Dave Wannstedt | Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>As of 2023, Dave has accrued a net worth of <strong>$18 million</strong>, mainly through his coaching activities in the NFL.</p><p>Having spent 20 years as a professional coach in the NFL and college, Wannastedt’s net worth should come as no surprise.</p><p>During his time in the coaching department, the 67-year-old regularly used to earn more than <strong>$1 million per year</strong>.</p><p>Interestingly, NFL coaches these days receive an average salary of <strong>$3 million per year</strong>. Thus, we feel that Dave retired from the game a bit too early.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wannstedt-938.jpg><p>Nevertheless, having a net worth of <strong>$18 million</strong> should be enough for the Pennsylvania native as he is 67 years old at the moment.</p><p>However, Dave still appears from time to time for Fox Sports as an NFL analyst, which pockets him thousands of dollars.</p><h2>Dave Wannstedt | Daughters & Wife</h2><p>Dave is involved in a 47 year-long marriage with his sweetheart, <strong>Janet Wannstedt.</strong> The couple got married back in 1973 in the presence of more than 200 family and friends.</p><p>Likewise, the pair had been in a long relationship before their marriage. In fact, the two met during their college days and have been together ever since.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Doesn’t get any better than family at Lake Max, Culver, IN!! ⁦<a href=#>@JimIrsay</a>⁩ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FBSLKYvOxl</a></p><p>— Coach Wannstedt (@CoachWannstedt) <a href=#>August 5, 2020</a></p><p>Also, the two lovebirds have been blessed with two daughters, <strong>Keri Wannstedt</strong> and <strong>Jamie Wannstedt</strong>.</p><p>Both the girls are married, but unfortunately, there is no information regarding their life.
