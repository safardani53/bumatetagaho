Ross is reckoned not only as a distinguished player for his on-court audacity but also for his spellbinding wedded life.</p><p>Biggish and graceful, Ross married his long-time girlfriend, Matijana, on June 4, 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ross-with-his-wife-and-kids.jpg><p>Matijana and Ross are like a match made in paradise, and they’re head over heels in love with one another.</p><p>The duo is well-endowed with two adorable kids; their first son Tristan was born in 2014, and their second daughter, Zoey, in 2018.</p><p>The Ross family seems to relish each other’s company.

Ross was getting snug with Amber even though he was already married to a model, Matijana Ross, in 2011.</p><p>There is no remedy for love but to love more. After rejuvenating their relationship, the couple got out of the situation and are now living a good life.</p><h2>Terrence Ross | Net Worth&nbsp;</h2><p>The 6’7″ majestic shooting guard/small forward, Terrence Ross, has a net worth of $25 million.&nbsp;</p><p>During his first year with Toronto Raptors in 2012-13, his salary was $2,563,320, and he earned around $2,678,640 in 2013-14.</p><p>Moreover, his salary in 2021-2022 with Orlando Magic is $12.5 million.
