They get very excited about some of the guests we have on. They like that sort of element, but they don’t watch.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News TV</h2></p><p>“They enjoy some of the stories I come home with. We go to lunches and dinners, and nice places and meet the chefs, and we all have a chat. It’s a very sociable industry. If you get on with people, it’s a lovely place to be.</p><p>“I think from that point of view they enjoy it. From the whole ‘my dad’s on telly’ thing, not a chance.”</p><p>Over the years, all manner of household names have appeared in the Saturday Kitchen studio, often quaffing wine while discussing their favourite foods and latest projects.</p><p>Comedian Micky Flanagan, I’m A Celeb winner Emily Atack, astronaut Tim Peake and Strictly’s Shirley Ballas have all shared stories and laughs, while BBC Breakfast duo Naga Munchetty and Charlie Stayt famously got carried away on the booze earlier this year and were accused by viewers of being “rude and obnoxious”.</p><p>But it's that variety of talent and background that constantly keeps Matt on his toes as he delves into their careers to find 90-minutes worth of talking points.</p><p>He said: “The guests are great. Invariably you could look at a brief on a Friday night and go ‘what am I going to talk to so and so about for an hour and a half?’ and then you look at the information behind them and you go, ‘I get it, this is why they’re famous, this is why they’re on top of their game’.</p><p>“It’s not a question of if they’re bad or not, it’s whether A) You’re a similar age and B) Do you have anything in common remotely?”</p><p>So who have been the best celebs he’s clicked with?</p><p>“Some of the guests just blow you away. Tom Allen always springs to mind. What a lovely guy he is, just a genuine warm, incredibly funny guy. No airs, no graces, no side to him, very very natural.</p><p>“And then there’s people who are comfortable in their own skin, like Gary Barlow. What an incredible guy, just so down to earth, so normal, despite his massive fame and fortune and general charisma and ability really. There’s so many people like that that are just comfortable because of where they’re at in life. That is so engaging, that’s what I love about meeting people.”</p><p>As with any live telly, there’s the potential for a toe-curling blooper or two along the way, but Saturday Kitchen is a more well-oiled machine than fans may realise.</p><p>While its casual vibe gives the impression Matt and co are improvising as they go, each programme has two run-throughs before it makes it on air - a script reading the day before and a full rehearsal the morning of the live show.</p><p>And if anything does go wrong, well Matt just takes it in his stride.</p><p>He said: “There’s nothing worse than when you see somebody on TV and they’re desperately trying to cover something up and it just looks slightly eggy, so you think ‘it happens’ and you get on with it and roll with it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000701028000.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000701027984.webp><p>And the programme’s occasional dip into the archives to show clips from past Beeb cooking shows gives Matt the time he needs to freshen himself up and prepare for the next segment.</p><p>“For me it’s a chance to nip out to the loo. It’s a chance to go and grab some water and talk to your guests. From my point of view it’s not panic stations at all.”</p><p>With Christmas round the corner, Matt’s now put his name to good use by partnering with the UK and Ireland Mushrooms Producers to get the nation using homegrown produce.</p><p>He’s even shared three delicious dishes as an alternative to the usual Christmas menu - English muffins topped with mushrooms, chestnut Mushroom&nbsp;Wellington and Stilton, mushroom and&nbsp;pear twists.</p><p>He said: “If you’re worried about eating meat to save the planet then you don’t want to be looking at nut roast because the nuts travel maybe 11,000 miles to reach your plate.</p><p>“I’ve done a mushroom wellington there which is far sexier, quite frankly.”</p><p>He continued: “I love to use mushrooms in my cooking and I also wanted to highlight the importance of having&nbsp;a more sustainable Christmas&nbsp;by purchasing local, seasonal ingredients to use in festive dishes.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“There’s loads of things you can do with mushrooms because if you're thinking of switching out meat then they keep their texture, which is the essential part, and they've got a meaty quality.”</p><p><strong>Credit:&nbsp;&nbsp;The UK and Ireland Mushrooms Producers has partnered with&nbsp;Matt&nbsp;Tebbutt&nbsp;to&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;the nation to be more sustainable&nbsp;during the&nbsp;Christmas&nbsp;period, inspiring&nbsp;the nation to cook flavourful food that highlights the versatility of mushrooms in recipes.
