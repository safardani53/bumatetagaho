And you don’t have to settle for boring black either as there are loads of fun colours out there to put you in the holiday mood before you even board the plane.</p><p>Some budget suitcases have integral locks, but if they don’t then it’s generally an easy process to fit a small padlock.</p><p>Inside, they often have interior pockets to keep small items and jewellery separate, as well as dividers and the usual luggage straps.</p><p>Telescopic handles and spinner wheels mean even cheap suitcases are supremely manoeuvrable across all types of floors and you may find soft cases even have pockets on the outside for last-minute airport buys.</p><p>When they’re this good, why spend more on luggage? The money you save will go towards that stunning holiday outfit or your spending money while you’re away.</p><h2>Best cheap suitcases at a glance:</h2><h2><strong>Rock Novo</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Rock-novo-medium.jpg><ul><li><strong>Rock Novo medium in navy, £79.99 from Amazon– <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Separate zipped top section, expandable, easy to move, spacious</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Lack of inside pockets</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>4/5</p><p>The Novo is a good-looking suitcase. It has eight spinner wheels, which make it really easy to pull – and I tested it on carpet, hard flooring and pavement.</p><p>I really like that the upper section is separated from the lower section by a zipped divider, so you can keep the contents of both parts of the case separate – great for storing shoes without worrying about marking your clothes.</p><p>The suitcase is also expandable, giving you an extra 7L capacity for all your holiday buys. There’s also a TSA lock and a 15-year warranty.</p><p><strong>Specification – Size: </strong>69 x 45 x 28/31cm <strong>weight when empty: </strong>3.9kg<strong> capacity: </strong>60/67L</p><h2><strong>Vonhaus Cabin Case</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_5497-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Vonhaus Pink Hard Shell Cabin Case, £42.99 – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Price, good internal layout</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>No side handle</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>3.5/5</p><p>This pretty cabin case is perfect for a weekend break or for a short business trip.</p><p>Inside, the divider in the top section keeps contents separate from the bottom. There’s a large, zipped pocket within the divider and a second zipped pocket in the lower section, so lots of space to keep small items secure. Luggage straps keep clothes in place.</p><p>The case is lightweight and made from ABS plastic so seems pretty sturdy. The spinner wheels mean the case is easy to pull across all flooring. There’s a telescopic handle as well as a soft-grip handle on the top.</p><p>It also has a combination lock, which is pretty good for a budget suitcase.</p><p><strong>Specification – Size: </strong>55 x 37 x 21cm <strong>weight when empty: </strong>2.5kg<strong> capacity: </strong>35L</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><h2><strong>It Luggage Attuned</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/It-luggage-attuned.jpg><ul><li><strong>It Luggage Attuned, £79.99 from Very – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> great capacity, price, expandable, 10-year warranty</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> could be more internal pockets for the size</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p><p>This suitcase boasts a massive 159L capacity when you use the expansion function – that’s a lot of clothes. It’s ideal for long-haul trips when you’re going to be away for more than just a couple of weeks – you could easily pack enough different outfits for a month or more.</p><p>Inside, the upper compartment is separated from the lower by a zipped divider. The divider itself features three elasticated pockets (great size for shoes) and a zipped mesh pocket.</p><p>The lower section of the case has luggage straps to hold everything in place, but no more pockets alas.</p><p>Outside, the shell is tough ABS plastic. The telescopic handle has three positions, and there’s a fixed handle on the top, with another on the side. The eight wheels are multi-directional for ease of movement and the Attuned glides freely on both hard flooring and carpet.</p><p>It has an integral TSA lock and comes with a 10-year warranty.</p><p>That's a lot of case for your money!</p><p><strong>Specification – Size: </strong>80 x 55.5 x 33.5cm (+7.6cm) <strong>weight when empty: </strong>5kg<strong> capacity: </strong>128/159L</p><h2><strong>Argos Featherstone Soft Suitcase</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Argos-featherstone-pink-large.jpg><ul><li><strong>Featherstone Soft Suitcase (Large), £55 from Argos – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Ample space, great price, 5-year guarantee</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>no lock</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>4/5</p><p>This suitcase is a great price and gives you a brilliant 86L of packing space – enough for multiple outfits, and lots of shoes and accessories.</p><p>Inside, the main compartment has luggage straps to secure your clothes and there’s a full-size mesh pocket in the top.</p><p>Outside, there’s a large pocket on the front of the case, and while there’s no combination lock, you could easily fit a padlock.</p><p>The spinner wheels mean the suitcase is easy to move, but there are only four of them – eight would have been better for when the case is full, but that’s a minor point really when you take into account the price point.</p><p>There’s a telescopic handle of course, as well as a padded handle on one side and a grab handle on the top.</p><p>We love the vibrant colour, it’s such a fun shade that screams holidays.</p><p><strong>Specification – Size: </strong>77 x 46.5 x 26.5cm <strong>weight when empty: </strong>2.79kg<strong> capacity: </strong>86L</p><h2><strong>Featherstone Hard Shell Suitcase</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Argos-featherstone-hard-shell-suitcase.webp><h2></h2><ul><li><strong>Featherstone Hard Shell Suitcase (Medium) £70 from Argos – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Good price<strong>, </strong>good manoeuvrability, internal divider, light for its size</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Could have more internal pockets</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>3.5/5</p><p>This is a well-priced suitcase that will easily see you through at least a week’s holiday, probably two.</p><p>It features eight 360° wheels and a telescopic handle so it’s simple to pull across hard floors, carpets and pavements. There’s also a handle on the top – the soft grip is really comfy to hold – and another on the side. If you need to set down your case there are four feet on the other side to stop the outer shell being damaged.</p><p>Inside, luggage straps in the bottom section keep your clothes secure, while there’s a zipped divider in the top section. This has a large, zipped pocket on one side, which is handy for keeping accessories or small items together.</p><p>The case also has a TSA lock and comes with a five-year guarantee.</p><p><strong>Specification – Size: </strong>67.5 x 46.5 x 25.5cm <strong>weight when empty: </strong>3.65kg<strong> capacity: </strong>66L</p><h2><strong>Tripp Chic</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/5019244382815_1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Tripp Chic in Sky Blue (Medium), £55 from Tripp – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here&nbsp;</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Expandable, fun colour, lightweight, price</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Four wheels (rather than eight), lack of inside pockets</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>4/5</p><p>The Chic is really lightweight for a hard-shell suitcase and you can certainly pack a lot into it.</p><p>Inside, the two sections are separated by a mesh divider in the top compartment, so you can keep the contents here separate and secure, but there are no internal pockets.</p><p>The bottom section has luggage straps, but again, no pockets. However, the case is expandable, giving you an extra 6L packing space if you need it.</p><p>The Chic has four multi-directional wheels and is easy to pull across the carpet and hard floors.</p><p>The telescopic handle has three positions, there’s a soft-grip handle on the top and another on one side.</p><p>We love the colour – think blue skies, blue sea – it definitely has a holiday feel to it.</p><p><strong>Specification – Size: </strong>67 x 45 x 28/31cm <strong>weight when empty: </strong>3.2kg<strong> capacity: </strong>66/72L</p><h2>Where to buy suitcases</h2><p>Looking for a stylish and cheap suitcase? Here are some well-known and loved retailers to check out today:</p><h2><strong>What is the cabin suitcase limit?</strong></h2><p>To avoid getting caught out and made to pay pricey fees, it's crucial to check out the airline's cabin luggage restrictions before you get to the airport.</p><p>Each airline has its own specific set of rules, and they can vary widely.</p><p>On international flights, the cabin bag size is usually around 56 x 45 x 25cm.</p><p>However, budget airlines generally have tighter restrictions, with sizes dependent on your ticket class.</p><p>Ryanair recently updated its cabin bag policy, so <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">check it out here.</a></p><p>You can also find <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">easyJet cabin bags policy here</a>, as well as those for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">British Airways</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Virgin Atlantic</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Emirates</a>&nbsp;and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jet2.com</a>.</p><h2>How to measure a suitcase</h2><p>Most manufacturers state the measurements of their suitcases online.</p><p>But if it’s an old case or an unusual shape, you might need to measure it yourself.</p><p>To start, place your suitcase in the upright position on a flat surface with any extendable handles tucked in.</p><p>Then measure from the flat surface to the top of the case (usually the handle) - this will give you the height of the case and it should include the wheels.</p><p>Then you just turn it on its side and repeat to get the width, and then lie it on its back to get the depth.</p><p>In all of the measurements, make sure that you include any handles and wheels as airlines count these towards the size of your bag.</p><h2><strong>What are the best suitcases?</strong></h2><p>Travelling can be stressful, especially when you have a to-do list as long as your arm and plenty to think about before you leave the house.</p><p>The best suitcase will be one that meets your individual needs, whether that be big enough for the whole family for a 10-day trip abroad, or a cabin bag for short city breaks.</p><p>The best and most reliable brands to look out for include <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Antler,</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tripp</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">American Tourister</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">it Luggage</a>&nbsp;and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Samsonite</a>.</p><p>Take a look at our guide above for inspiration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZnFrY22Fdn%2BOnJ%2BemaBiwLa105yYrJ2jZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lady-antebellum-pics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley &amp;amp; Dave Haywood  Hollywood Life">&larr;
