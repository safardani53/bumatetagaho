Watts is also a&nbsp;stand-up comedian, actor, and beatboxer. The music director takes pride in his versatile talents and usually focuses on improvisations during any of his head-turning performances. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Watts's&nbsp;significant weight loss has been the head-turner as&nbsp;he is seen more&nbsp;fit than before. He used to be on the larger side during his pre-James Corden days but has gone on to sport a muscular physique as of late. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>From Fat To Fit: Reggie Watts’ Secrets To Weight Loss</h2><p>Before Watts got the job at The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2014,&nbsp;he was not as lean as he is now. Watts was prey to bad eating habits, as he himself puts it. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>During an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with GQ</a> in May 2018, he said he looked like he was in a fat suit while performing gigs.&nbsp;He added that his weight gain was probably because&nbsp;he was touring a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>I felt like an in-shape guy in a fat suit...I’d be like, “Argh, I can move much better than that, and I can look much better than that.”</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>As he further <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told J.R. Sullivan of Men’s Journal</a>, whenever he felt like he was running low on energy or melancholic, he resorted to food, thinking that it would make him feel good. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That eventually led him to go to hotel minibars, and it made him feel even more terrible. The same was the case when he was in his hometown,&nbsp;Brooklyn, with lots of great restaurants to go out and eat.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Did Landing A Job At The Late Late Show Motivate&nbsp;Watts To Get Fit?&nbsp;</h2><p>After Watts got the&nbsp;job on The Late Late Show and moved&nbsp;to&nbsp;Los Angeles,&nbsp;he concluded that he was done being overweight and wanted to change the way he looked.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>While it is not clear how exactly that resolve came about, one of the first changes he made to his lifestyle was changing&nbsp;his eating habits. To do that, Watts started getting his food delivered by an organic meal delivery&nbsp;service based in Los Angeles&nbsp;called Kore Kitchen. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His modular meals consisted of baked chicken, steamed broccoli, cod, and wilted spinach.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Along with changing his diet, Watts also got a nutritionist and found a trainer. He worked with Jorgen de Mey, a fitness trainer, and took a breakfast recipe that he created.</p><p>It consisted of “just half a cup of water, half a cup of plain kefir, a cup of oats, one scoop of chocolate egg-white protein, and a handful of blueberries.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Watts, who was just eight pounds from his goal&nbsp;weight in August 2018,&nbsp;revealed to GQ that, at the time, he was trying to get around 12 percent body fat and get “really ripped and cut.”</p><p>Watts — who is a proponent of weed — also incorporated marijuana into his diet at the time. He started consuming <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mondo cannabis powder</a> while searching for a product that didn't give him food cravings.</p><p>In his own words, "It doesn’t give you the munchies; it just makes you feel groovy."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>How Much Progress Has Reggie Watts Made Over The Years?</h2><p>From the time he started working alongside James Corden to the time he gave the interview with GQ, Watts changed quite a lot in terms of body weight.</p><p>In a time frame of about three years, he has&nbsp;shed some 60 pounds of fat.&nbsp;In addition to this, he also&nbsp;put on 20 pounds of muscle weight.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In a July 29 2021 episode of&nbsp;The Late Late Show With James Corden,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Watts</a> looks great as he and Ed Sheeran ask each other a few questions while engaging in some light-hearted banter.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Even though his most recent weight information is not readily available, going through his Instagram and seeing him on the TV certainly reveals that he doesn't&nbsp;look&nbsp;like he will be slowing down anytime soon. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGikrquZmHyzscagoJ5lp5bBtb%2BMsJyin5ipeq270qxloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./celebrity-mastermind-2023-full-line-up-revealed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebrity Mastermind 2023 full line-up revealed - from This Morning stars to The Apprentice winners">&larr;
