I did most of the bass lying down on a comfortable sofa and it made me stand up, jump up and down. I lost it. It was wonderful."</p><p>The song, called St Charles’ Square, is truly excellent and proves that despite their lengthy break from music, Blur are back — and they are better than ever.</p><p>Following their warm-up gigs, including in Eastbourne on Sunday night, Wolverhampton next Friday and Newcastle on May 28, they will go to Wembley stadium for two huge shows on July 8 and 9.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p>Alex said of the live shows: “We have stripped it right back to basics. It’s just the four of us.”</p><p>Damon continued: “That is how we wanted to play live too.</p><p>“We imagine Wembley as us at our purest and most uncomplicated.</p><p>“The original intention, not the one you get carried away with once you become a big band.</p><p>“How we play tonight [in Colchester] is how we will play at Wembley but, hopefully, we presume it will be better there</p><p>“But the intention, the reason we are doing it, is the same whether it is here or there.”</p><p>Blur had a string of No1 albums in the Nineties and Noughties and hit singles including Tender and Country House. And last night’s concert was packed with nostalgia.</p><p>If you are lucky enough to have a ticket to any of their upcoming shows, I can guarantee you won’t be disappointed.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Beckhams hedge bets for privacy</h2><p>DAVID and <a href=#>Victoria Beckham</a> have come up with a novel way to keep nosy Soho Farmhouse members from peeping into their Cotswolds home.</p><p>I can reveal the couple are shelling out thousands of pounds to beef up security at their country mansion and adding “instant hedges” after complaining about prying eyes from the trendy members’ retreat at the end of their lane.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TM-comp-Beckhams-hedge.jpg><p>It follows reports that the issue had become so annoying that <a href=#>Posh </a>and <a href=#>Becks </a>had even considered upping sticks and selling the place entirely.</p><p>Work has already begun at the multi-million-pound pad, with a 3m-tall barrier created from individual installed hedge plants around the rear of the estate which backs on to the farmhouse.</p><p>The couple’s home was previously in full view across the field from the VIP members’ club, which is popular with the likes of <a href=#>Harry Styles</a> and <a href=#>Dua Lipa</a>.</p><p>But thanks to their bespoke topiary, it will now be almost impossible for fans to catch a glimpse through the new hedges.</p><p>A source said: “The Beckhams were planning on selling up in January but it looks like they have found a solution to their problems.</p><p>“Big hedges will help shield them from prying eyes and keep any excess noise out.”</p><p>How the other half live indeed.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Robbie on the mothership</h2><p>ROBBIE WILLIAMS says his obsession with UFOs and aliens was sparked by his mum, Janet.</p><p><a href=#>The Angels singer</a> says that when he was younger, his mother “considered herself a white witch”.</p><p>Robbie said: “When I grew up, outside of my mother’s bedroom was a shelf of books and in those books were folklores and fairy tales. I think my mum considered ­herself somewhat of a white witch.</p><p>“So there were all of these interesting books that were mind-expanding. At my grandma’s there were books like ‘UFOs Over London’.”</p><p>He added of his own beliefs about the unexplained and supernatural: “I’m checking in with UFO Twitter.</p><p>“From 2005 and 2006, when it was the wild, wild west of the ­internet, it was a ­wonderful place to go.</p><p>“Where I stand on it all is that my mind is open and everything is on the table. I don’t believe in anything, but if people want to come and say that things happened to them then I’ll say, ‘Well, that’s interesting.’</p><p>“But it’s not a hill I’m going to go and die on – ‘Well, I think this, and this is definitely happening’ – because nobody knows.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>It's too hot fur Rita</h2><p>RITA ORA can’t decide if she is Hot Right Now in the latest video for new single Praising You.</p><p>Dressing for all weathers, <a href=#>Rita </a>mixes a slashed strap top and mini skirt with a floor length faux fur coat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/84a3c9b3-8fac-4093-8852-3dd3b9c9d72c.jpg><p>The clip, shot by director Joseph Kahn, is the second video for the <a href=#>Fatboy Slim</a> collaboration, which samples his hit Praise You.</p><p>The song is the second single from Rita’s upcoming third album You & I – which she has likened to an open diary about finding The One in director <a href=#>Taika Waititi</a>.</p><p>The couple <a href=#>secretly tied the knot </a>last summer in London.</p><p>Rita says she hopes to have a bash to celebrate the nuptials in the near future.</p><p>I can only assume her outfit for the occasion will be as wacky as this one.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Jessie J's big news</h2><p>CONGRATULATIONS to Jessie J, who has given birth to a son.</p><p>The <a href=#>Do It Like A Dude singer </a>took to Instagram last night to announce <a href=#>the happy news.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/editorial-use-jessie-j-arrives-795736502-1.jpg><p>Jessie said: “A week ago my whole life changed.
