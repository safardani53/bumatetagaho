Family members were also there to celebrate the happy occasion.&nbsp;Later, the gang was seen celebrating at Surf Lodge in Montauk, New York. According to a Page Six source, Surf Lodge workers brought out several magnums to commemorate the occasion. Jesse’s brother Jake, as well as his girlfriend Millie Bobby Brown, are said to have sent their best wishes from London.</p><h2>Everything there is to know about Jon Bon Jovi’s kid</h2><p>Jesse James Louis Bongiovi is a well-known wine businessman. He was the first son and second child of famed singer-songwriter Jon Bon Jovi and his wife Dorothea Hurley, born on February 19, 1995. He later relocated to Manhattan and attended Poly Prep in Brooklyn. He participated in the school’s lacrosse and football programs while at Poly Prep.&nbsp;Following graduation, he enrolled at the University of Notre Dame to study political science and business economics.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jesse-Bongiovi-2.jpg alt="Jesse Bongiovi" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>During his senior year, he intended to launch a wine label alongside his father and France-based winemaker Gerard Bertrand. As a result, Hampton Water Rose Wine was released in 2018.&nbsp;In the Hamptons, rose wine is quite popular. Jesse and his pals used to call the drink Hampton Water. His father came out one day when he was sitting on the veranda of his East Hampton House and inquired if he had some “pink juice,” which was his word for rose wine.</p><p>Jesse responded by telling his father to name it Hampton Water. Jon Bon Jovi felt it was an intriguing concept and proposed using it as the title of a bottle of wine. Jesse devised a marketing strategy for the winery, and the father-son team sought Gerard for assistance. In 2018, the brand was established two years after their morning talk. Jesse is also on social media, where he publishes largely about his personal and professional life.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jesse-Bongiovi-3.jpg alt="Jesse Bongiovi" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>What are Jon Bon Jovi’s other children’s names?</h2><p>Jon Bon Jovi married Dorothea Hurley in 1989. Jacob Hurley, Stephanie Rose, Jesse, and Romeo Jon are their four children. Jacob is a Syracuse University student who rose to prominence in 2018 after organizing a national student walkout to protest the government’s response to mass school shootings in the aftermath of the Parkland, Florida shooting. He is said to be dating Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things.&nbsp;Stephanie Rose, Jon and Dorothea’s only child, is a television camera operator at the age of 28. She was a cast member of the TV show Impractical Jokers. Stephanie was arrested on narcotics charges in 2012, while still in college, after a suspected heroin overdose. The charges were eventually withdrawn. Romeo Jon is Jon and Dorothea’s youngest child, and he tries to avoid the spotlight more than the other three children.</p><p>In 1983, Jon Bon Jovi founded the rock band, Bon Jovi. The group’s debut song, Runaway, was published in 1981, and their third album, Slippery When Wet, earned them acclaim. Jon Bon Jovi has had a successful solo career, recording soundtracks for films such as Young Guns II and Stand Up Guys. He has featured in a number of films, including The Leading Man, Destination Anywhere, Row Your Boat, New Year’s Eve, and others. He is also well-known for his roles in television shows such as 30 Rock, The West Wing, Las Vegas, and others.&nbsp;In 2009, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnqujmnqju82goKiumWK0sMCMraZmoJmoeq27zaBkrZ2ionqotdGlnauhlaOxbrbErKqeZZyetKnAjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sebastian-stan-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photos of the Marvel Actor Over the Years  Hollywood Life">&larr;
