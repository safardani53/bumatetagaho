He didn't go to sleep easily.</p><p>"And he would come home with, he'd be physically look exhausted, he'd have a shake or eat a meal and go to working on music, go to his room, start writing or harmonising and mead to try and figure out another song."</p><p>The 26-year-old said his father saw himself as the "greatest of all time" - and claimed to be "bigger” than infamous chart star and pop rival <a href=#>Prince</a>.</p><p>Jackson <a href=#>died suddenly at just 50-years-old</a> in 2009 from an overdose, when his son was just 12.</p><p>One of the most famous men in the world, his infamous career was rocked by near-constant scandal — including repeated child sex abuse allegations.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>As of 2019, the music mogul was still one of the world’s highest- earning singers, raking in an incredible £150million every year.</p><p>Jackson's eldest son claimed that no current star compares to his dad as an artist - although he thinks Beyonce comes the closest to his father's appeal.</p><p>He also opened up about some music recorded by the pop icon which has yet to be heard by the public.</p><p>Jackson's unreleased music is sitting in archives ready to be finished, Prince said.</p><p>Prince explained that much of the music is made up of rough clips because of the unique way his father learnt to play instruments and perform.</p><p>"When it comes to unreleased music there, what we have in our vault is, as I've been kind of told, is a lot of really rough works in progress," he said.</p><p>"So it's a lot of little snippets of 'he he' and stuff like that. I don't think my father ever learned how to read sheet music.</p><p>"So as a trained musician, it was all really self-taught. And when that translated to the way he would write music and create songs.</p><p>"There's actually maybe clips of it too, where he would do the beat with his mouth and his vocals for Beaded or Billie Jean.</p><p>"He would sing the beat and then layer on the tracks over that.”</p><p>Prince is currently working with Hollywood producer Graham King on a biopic about his father's life and career that has been eight years in the making.</p><p>Prince, whose full name is Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., is the eldest son of Michael and his second wife, <a href=#>Debbie Rowe</a>.</p><p>He works as an actor and producer, known for Daybreak, Hangin' with the Homeboys, and Nano: Hold On, according to IMDb.</p><p>When the couple divorced in 1999, Rowe relinquished custody and full parental rights of their two children, Prince and his younger sister <a href=#>Paris</a>.</p><p>Jackson had a third child, Blanket, in 2002.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The children had a bizarre upbringing - from a reclusive lifestyle at <a href=#>Neverland</a>, to questions about who their real parents are, to being covered with head scarves for outings.</p><p>In 2002, Jackson held eight-month-old Blanket over the balcony of a Berlin hotel in horrifying footage that swept the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/prince-jackson-attends-23rd-annual-838824373-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/NINTCHDBPICT000804255478.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/never-before-seen-pictures-michael-19050795.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2002-media-award-lifetime-achievement-1767082-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxYWWBeoSTaJ%2BaqqKuerTA2KWcrGWbnruoec6fZKmnoGK6qq%2FHmpylZZqWsKy%2FzqeqZqufo3qxvsinmp5n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./liam-hemsworth-frightens-miley-cyrus-warns-elsa-pataky-is-next.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Liam Hemsworth Frightens Miley Cyrus Again, Warns Sister-in-Law Elsa Pataky, 'You're Next'">&larr;
