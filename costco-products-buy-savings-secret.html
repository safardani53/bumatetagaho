by Jessica, who has been recommending products to buy at stores including&nbsp;<a href=#>Costco</a>&nbsp;for most of her life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Costco.jpg><p>But the 33-year-old, who lives in Quebec,&nbsp;<a href=#>Canada</a>, has taken it a step further with an outreach now on <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a>, which she started up in March 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>This was Jessica’s way of passing up boredom during quarantine by entertaining a virtual audience.&nbsp;</p><p>She also shares her content on her <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> channel as well.</p><p>On both social media platforms, she is known as "@lifebyjessica."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON STORE PRODUCTS">READ MORE ON STORE PRODUCTS</h2><p>It’s important to note that Jessica’s content goes beyond grocery products and Costco, as she also makes makeup and skincare-related videos.</p><p>And while she does post&nbsp;<a href=#>money-saving tips</a>&nbsp;time-to-time, she is more focused on the quality of products.&nbsp;</p><p>“I try not to really niche myself down to one market, not necessarily just beauty or not necessarily just skincare,” Jessica told The Sun.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have Dollarama stuff that goes pretty viral too [and] <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a> stuff.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>For those who don’t know, Dollarama is widely considered the Dollar Tree of Canada.&nbsp;</p><p>There are more than 460 locations in the country.&nbsp;</p><p>Already, Jessica’s following on&nbsp;TikTok&nbsp;has grown past 230,000.&nbsp;</p><p>And her&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;base has grown to more than 20,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Products to buy at Costco</strong></h2><p>For fellow Costco shoppers, she has a full list of products she recommended buying.&nbsp;</p><p>But keep in mind, shopping at the store is exclusive for members only.&nbsp;</p><p>It costs either $120 or $60 per year, depending on the membership tier that you want.</p><p>Additionally, Jessica has provided some comment on the products she recommends buying, which is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Cerave Moisturizing Cream:</strong> My go-to moisturizer for the face and body!</li><li><strong>Kirkland Chocolate Covered Almonds:</strong> Most delicious chocolate almonds ever</li><li><strong>Olivia Butterfly shrimp: </strong>Easy to make and incredibly flavorful</li><li><strong>Bath sheets Drap De Bain:</strong> They don't always have these ones but when they do I grab one, they're so big and cozy</li><li><strong>Skinny Pop:</strong> Great when you're in the mood for something salty!</li><li><strong>Lean Turkey Pepperoni:</strong> Really good grab-and-go snack.</li></ul><h2><strong>Products to avoid at Costco</strong></h2><p>Not every product is going to satisfy everyone at Costco.</p><p>Specifically, Jessica recommends avoiding Andrea-branded Mediterranean Medley at the store.</p><p>These products come in containers filled with antipasto items including olives, cheese, and peppers.</p><p>Another product Jessica did not like from Costco was the Bacon wrapped scallops.</p><p>Jessica said that she was disappointed with the flavor.</p><p>The Sun has also recently&nbsp;<a href=#>revealed</a>&nbsp;items at Costco to buy and avoid.</p><p>The following items are the ones to additionally stay away from at the warehouse:</p><ul><li>Toilet paper</li><li>Over-the-counter medications</li><li>Fruits and Vegetables</li><li>Cooking oil</li></ul><p>Some of these products lack taste quality, while others are just not worth the money.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>A Costco gift card savings secret</strong></h2><p>Additionally, there’s a Costco gift card secret that you need to check out that can save you money that Jessica has touted.</p><p>“For gift cards to be sold at Costco, they have to offer some kind of deal to the customer,” Jessica said.</p><p>In fact, buying gift cards at Costco can<a href=#>&nbsp;save</a>&nbsp;you up to $50.</p><p>In a recent<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;video</a>, Jessica showed that there were two $50 Jack Astor’s gift cards listed for only $79.99 in total at the store.</p><p>In addition to in-store, gift cards at Costco can be bought online.&nbsp;</p><p>To purchase online, you can visit the wholesaler’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Gift Cards & Tickets</a>&nbsp;section.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll need a membership and an account to be eligible for the gift card savings.</p><p>Currently, Costco has a $500 e-gift card at Southwest Airlines listed for just $449.99.</p><p>You can also buy five $20 e-gift cards at Peet’s Coffee for just $79.99.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>More advice for saving money</strong></h2><p>While saving money isn’t Jessica’s main focus, she does have a couple of more tips for shoppers looking at that perspective.</p><p>Most importantly, Jessica said it’s key to do your research and price compare with other retailers.&nbsp;</p><p>Jessica used an example of buying an onion chopper on <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a> for $25 when she could have bought one at Dollarama for only $3 or $4.</p><p>“Know what's out there and know what price you're looking for,” Jessica said.</p><p>At Costco, in particular, Jessica said you might be able to get great deals by buying products in bulk.</p><p>“I think it's Crest toothpaste, they have five or six bottles, [which] you can get for $12 or something like that,” Jessica said.</p><p>She added, “Whereas one bottle is like $6.99 - and it's significantly smaller.”</p><p>Moreover, Jessica recommends checking the liquidation section at your local stores to find deals.</p><p>For instance, Jessica’s local grocery store has big sections filled with makeup and home goods.</p><p>“Oftentimes, they'll put their seasonal products in their liquidation section,” Jessica said.</p><p>“So [buy] summer items in the fall for the next summer.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>For more on Costco, see<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;six
