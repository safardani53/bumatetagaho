"I just smother them in love," she shared while speaking to Healthy Living in 2014. "They are my priority. That's what I do. That's what I care most about. I keep them close to me and make sure they are happy and healthy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lisa Marie welcomed daughter Riley and son Benjamin with her ex-husband Danny Keough, whom she was married to from 1988 to 1994.

She was open about her grief in the years after, posting tributes on Benjamin's birthday and penning an emotional essay for PEOPLE in 2022 about the loss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong>For more on Lisa Marie Presley, listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day.</strong></a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's a real choice to keep going, one that I have to make every single day and one that is constantly challenging to say the least ... <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>But I keep going for my girls</a>," she wrote in honor of National Grief Awareness Day.

She was transported to a local hospital after EMTs responded to the singer's home and administered CPR. Shortly after, her mother, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Priscilla Presley</a>, confirmed the news of her daughter's death in a statement to PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It is with a heavy heart that I must share the devastating news that my beautiful daughter Lisa Marie has left us," Priscilla said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An autopsy ultimately determined that Lisa Marie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>died of a small bowel obstruction</a>. According to the coroner's report, "the obstruction was in the form of a strangulated small bowel caused by adhesions that developed after bariatric surgery years ago."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lisa Marie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>was laid to rest at Graceland</a> next to her son, Benjamin.

But on Jan. 26, 2023, attorneys for Priscilla filed a petition questioning the "authenticity and validity" of Lisa Marie's will, claiming that a 2016 amendment, which willed the trust to her three daughters, was invalid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the petition, Priscilla hoped the courts would instead honor an amendment Lisa Marie made in 2010, making Priscilla a co-trustee alongside her former business manager, Barry Siegel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two months later, in May 2023, Priscilla and Riley <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>reached a settlement</a> in the fight over Lisa Marie's trust, with both sides reportedly "happy" with the outcome.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My family has resolved all confusion as it relates to our plea to the court and request for document interpretation after my daughter Lisa Marie's untimely passing," Priscilla said in a statement to PEOPLE.

Riley has been open about how her mother and grandmother allowed her to grow up to be her own person, instead of living in the shadow of her famous grandfather. In September 2007, Riley explained to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Oprah Winfrey</a> that, while she knew who her grandfather was as a child, it wasn't "this huge thing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That doesn't mean that Elvis hasn't been a big figure in Riley's life. When Riley attended the premiere of her film <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mad Max: Fury Road</a> alongside her mother and grandmother, the trio were described as "the Presley women."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Riley began modeling in 2004, and in May 2022, she made her directorial debut with her first film, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>War Pony</a>, at the Cannes Film Festival. Riley was happy to be at the festival with her co-director <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Gina Gammell</a>, saying, "We're really just grateful to be here.

"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Two months without you</a>. I would give anything for 1 more minute with you little brother," she wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One year later, Riley told The New York Times that the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>last year had been difficult</a>. It had been "a year of feeling like I was thrown into the ocean and couldn't swim," Riley said. "The first four or five months, I couldn't get out of bed. I was totally debilitated. I couldn't talk for two weeks."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While discussing her Amazon Prime Video show Daisy Jones & The Six, Riley revealed how her character reminded her of her mom.

It also revealed that she and Smith-Petersen had welcomed a baby girl.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm eternally grateful to have spent 33 years with you.

Following the news of his death in July 2020, a rep for Lisa Marie told PEOPLE, "She is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter Riley, She adored that boy. He was the love of her life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Benjamin's friend, Brandon Howard, spoke to PEOPLE about Benjamin's struggle with mental health and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>"pressure" to live up to the Presley name</a>. "Sometimes he struggled with depression, which is a serious thing with [the COVID-19 pandemic] and everything happening right now and everybody being locked in the house," he said. "It's a tough thing when you have a lot of pressure with your family and living up to a name and an image. It's a lot of pressure. It's almost like you're pressured into having to be a musician, having to be an actor. It was good for him to go around the world and discover himself and have his own friends."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Howard also remembered Benjamin as the person who would help others even when he was facing his own battle.

The pair later announced that they were in fact <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>expecting twins</a>. Daughters <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Finley Aaron Love</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Harper Vivienne Anne</a> were born on Oct. 7, 2008.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lisa Marie's mother, Priscilla Presley, was present for Finley Harper's births. Priscilla said that she saw each baby take their first breaths and that she was "very thrilled" about becoming a grandmother again. Shortly after, Priscilla spoke to Entertainment Tonight about how Lisa Marie and Lockwood were doing. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mother is doing great</a>," she said. "Father's a little nervous. He's a first-time dad, so it is the most beautiful thing to watch the way he holds and carries the babies. It's so endearing to watch how delicate he is with the babies."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-110 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After 10 years of marriage, Lisa Marie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>filed for divorce</a> from Lockwood in June 2016. The two were soon engaged in a tough custody battle, and the twins were placed in protective custody after Lisa Marie's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>legal team alleged</a> that "disturbing" photos of children were found on a computer belonging to Lockwood. The twins <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>lived with their grandmother</a> following the allegations. "There is Lots of confusion, commotion and concern from all the talk circulating," Priscilla shared on Facebook. "Let me put this to rest … the girls have not been in foster care and never will be. The girls have been with me and will be until all this is sorted out."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-112 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>closed its inquiry</a> into the allegations in 2017, with T.B.I. Public Information Officer Josh DeVine telling PEOPLE, "Barring any new potential evidence or information, we have concluded our involvement in this matter. We have not been able to determine if a crime occurred in Tennessee and accordingly do not have an open investigation." The office also made it clear that a formal investigation was never opened, only an inquiry to "determine if [it] could substantiate information with which to open a case."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-114 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-115 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In October 2017, Lisa Marie stepped out with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>all three of her daughters</a> at an ELLE Women in Hollywood event. This was the first time Lisa Marie had attended a public event with all three girls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-117 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, Lisa Marie and the twins began <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fostering rescue puppies</a>. Lisa Marie shared the news on Instagram when she posted a photo of the twins and herself holding one of the dogs. "We've been fostering pups from a shelter," she wrote. "Exhausting but so rewarding 👍🐶 be well❤️."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-119 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Lisa Marie's death, Lockwood said that their twins would "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>carry on the family legacy</a>" in a statement to PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-121 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The most important thing to me at this time is to take care of my daughters, making sure they always feel safe and loved," he said.
