They dated for six years before saying “I do” in a Catholic ceremony at the Las Alamandas resort outside Puerto Vallarta, Mexico in Apr. 2004. Their marriage was annulled after only two weeks after Mario admitted to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cheating on Ali</a> at his bachelor party, during an interview with <strong>Howard Stern </strong>on the radio host’s show. “It was my bachelor party,” Mario said, adding that he had been “bouncing around” Mexico with his cousins.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“I had no business of being in that position,” he continued. “It was spring break….everybody was hanging out. That was a situation where I was not mature and man enough.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Mario was caught hanging out poolside with the other woman by an onlooker, who took a photo and later leaked it. Ali’s sister then got a hold of it, and when Ali also saw it, she confronted her new husband and he confessed he wasn’t ready to be serious with anyone. “I was wrong for obviously lying, and I shouldn’t have been in that position,” he told Howard. “I dealt with all this drama, and then at that point just realize…I finally got the balls to say ‘Hey, listen I’m not ready for this, I’m sorry.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yaqaKnXaG8sbHZZq6inpVigXmClW9wcmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./costco-products-buy-savings-secret.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Im a Costco superfan - six products that are must-buys and my secret how to save up to $50 on gif">&larr;
