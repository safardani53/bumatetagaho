Lala Kent was unclear whether she would be returning to the program until 24 hours before production began.&nbsp;She just made the startling announcement that she will be returning to the beloved program. Along with Lala, all of the Season 9 stars will return, including James, Katie, Schwartz, Raquel, Tom Sandoval, Ariana Madix, Scheana Shay, Brock Davies, and Charli Burnett.</p><p>The Vanderpump Rules star is now unmarried and focusing her efforts on her kid, job, and book promotion. She also runs her cosmetics firm from home and controls the personnel. Many people may be wondering what prompted Lala to decide to return to the reality TV program with so much on her plate.</p><h2>Why did Lala Kent decide to return for Season 10 of Vanderpump Rules?</h2><p>Lala said to US Weekly that shooting a reality TV program is really exhausting. She also said that they just began shooting two days ago and that she wasn’t sure whether she wanted to come back up until the night before they started.&nbsp;The Vanderpump Rules actress also said that she was debating whether or not to participate in Season 10. She was longing for the camera to be on her face after watching one original episode of Real Housewives of New York (RHONY).</p><p>Lala also said that Season 10 of Vanderpump Rules will be the first time fans will see her single. She went on to say that they hadn’t seen her single since she first appeared on the program, and that even in Season 4, she was hooked on her ex, who was an elusive person.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lala-Kent-2.jpg alt="Lala Kent" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Lala further said that in previous seasons, she was observed having sexual encounters with James Kennedy every five seconds and was subsequently in a relationship. As a result, this would be her first appearance on the program as a “totally single” person.&nbsp;The Vanderpump Rules actress also said that fans will see her focusing on her kid and moving into the dating scene, something she is really enthusiastic about.</p><p>Lala also said that her life is no longer the same as it was during Season 9 and that she is in a good position. Continuing, she expressed her joy at being reunited with her pals, which made her forget about the cameras. Lala also said that this was her third season of sobriety and that it had been the greatest ever.</p><h2>What is the status of Lala Kent’s relationship with former co-star Jax Taylor and other cast members?</h2><p>After a series of ups and downs with Jax Taylor, Lala said that she had just one valid reason to continue friends with him. The Vanderpump Rules actress told US Weekly that she was friendly with him since Brittany Cartwright was one of her closest pals.&nbsp;Kala used Katie Maloney and Tom Schwartz’s marriage as an example, saying that if the pair was still married, she would have to navigate those waters the same way she does with Jax and Brittany.</p><p>She also said that the on-screen turmoil messes up her friendships off-screen. She went on to say that she sometimes questioned why they couldn’t have a regular life. But she responded to the question herself, arguing that if she was normal and didn’t obsess about little matters, she wouldn’t have a reality TV program.&nbsp;Lala may be successful in every aspect of her life, but there is one area where she is stuck. Her Bravo profile states:</p><p>“Friendships are put to the test as Scheana questions her devotion and Ariana challenges her.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lala-Kent-3.jpg alt="Lala Kent" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Katie and Lala, on the other hand, seem to be doing well. After learning about the latter’s divorce from Tom, Lala said that she seemed lighter to her. She opened out, saying that the gravity had lifted and that it was a pleasure to see Katie in such a vulnerable condition.</p><p>Lala went on to say that she stayed at Katie’s side during her separation and divorce from Tom and that the Vanderpump Rules actress opened up to her a lot. She went on to say that there was something about Katie’s eyes that made her seem cheerful. Regarding her relationship with Tom, Lala said that she would not be speaking with him anytime soon. Lala said on What Happens Live with Andy Cohen that she broke connections with Tom and hasn’t spoken to him since.&nbsp;She went on to say that she felt betrayed by him since he continued to hang out with Randall while knowing he cheated on her.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijmqSRYrimutNmn5qrXZa7r7vUp5qenF2ptaLAjKyfnmWnnrmtedGeq66qnmLBsHnVmqWdnaKlwq68jKuspZ2jZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./monica-deltas-boyfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Mnica Delta Dating  Mnica Delta's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes">&larr;
