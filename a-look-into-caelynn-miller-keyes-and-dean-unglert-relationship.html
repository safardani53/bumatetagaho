The pair began planning their wedding after becoming engaged in October on a trip to the Galapagos Islands. They are, however, eventually disclosing the information.&nbsp;Caelynn discussed her engagement to Dean in an interview with Us Weekly’s Here for the Right Reasons podcast. She stated:</p><p>“I kept remembering when I knew he was The One when I knew we were going to be married. I believe we just continued talking about it, and I kept making jokes about it. And I believe the more I made fun of it, the more he thought, ‘OK, maybe I could get married.'”</p><p>Caelynn went on to say that she wasn’t aware when they realized they wanted to marry. The Bachelor alum also said that she didn’t know when she and Dean would propose to one other and marry. She went on to say that she wanted to take things slowly and enjoy the period. Caelynn also revealed that she wanted to put on gowns before becoming engaged, but her friend persuaded her not to do so and to instead enjoy the engagement process. She and Dean have started planning their wedding now that they are officially engaged.</p><h2>Caelynn Miller Keyes and Dean Unglert, both of The Bachelor fame, will marry in Aspen.</h2><p>Caelynn said that she and Dean are at “the fun fiance” stage and have begun exploring venues. She said that the couple intends to marry in Aspen, saying:</p><p>“We want all of our friends to be there, so we’re getting married in Aspen. But then I thought, ‘Bam, maybe here.’ And he said, ‘I have my mind made up,’ and when his mind is made up, he can’t be spoken to.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Caelynn-Miller-Keyes-1.jpg alt="Caelynn Miller-Keyes" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In addition, The Bachelor alum added:</p><p>And I was like, ‘You don’t realize that the wedding process is full of choices and changes, so should I simply ignore you?’ And he said, ‘I’m not sure.’ So, we’ll see what happens.”</p><p>Caelynn went on to say that she had already chosen a dress for the engagement party and had begun looking for clothes for the wedding. She said that she wanted two outfits for her wedding.&nbsp;“I wasn’t taken aback”: Caelynn said that she was aware Dean was about to propose.&nbsp;Caelynn and Dean married in October 2022. Dean’s proposal did not surprise her, she said in an interview with Hollywood Life, but the setting did:</p><p>“I wasn’t surprised by the engagement, but I was surprised by where it occurred.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Caelynn-Miller-Keyes-2.jpg alt="Caelynn Miller-Keyes" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Dean proposed after the pair had been dating for nearly three years. Dean and Caelynn went on to date on ABC’s Bachelor in Paradise. She said that she had begun wedding preparations when they were going to the Galapagos:</p><p>“I like making plans. It’s my absolute favorite thing in the whole universe. We had six flights to the Galapagos this week, so I had a lot of time on my hands and did a lot of preparing.”</p><p>According to Hollywood Life, The Bachelor alum claimed that she and Dean originally planned a modest wedding in Italy with their families. They have now changed their minds and decided on Aspen as the ultimate location for their wedding.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYZqSfpLhutc2tpmabkZq5urrNZqSipJyav263xLKcrGWRo7FusMSapWatnpy5pr7TZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jennie-garth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennie Garth">&larr;
