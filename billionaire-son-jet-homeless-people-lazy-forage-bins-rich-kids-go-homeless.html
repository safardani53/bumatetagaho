It's really weird having them stand offish like that.”</p><p>Spending the night in a makeshift bed on the wet pavement, he says: “I've experienced so many emotions tonight that I would normally never experience.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000488294755.jpg><p>Day two doesn’t go much better for the heir, as a hungry Bobby is forced to go foraging in bins for food and hunts in phone boxes for left change.</p><p>He can’t contain his excitement when he discovers some headphones and a beanie hat that someone has left behind and describes them as “treasure”.</p><p>Things are looking up for the Bobby, as he pawns the headphones to an electronic shop for £40.</p><p>His next plan is to buy and sell multi-bags of crisps at tube station entrances for a profit, which is unsuccessful.</p><p>He decides to spend the £40 he has on accommodation for the night – but is unable to get into a hostel due to needing to have ID.</p><p>Faced with the prospect of spending another chilly night on the streets, he admits he has realised that being homeless is an “uphill battle” and he gets why many turn to drugs and alcohol.</p><p>He said: “You don't want to live sober because life just sucks.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000488293597.jpg><p>On his final day sleeping rough, he encounters couple Demi and Aaron, both 20, who have been homeless on and off for the past three years.</p><p>They reveal they arrived in London from Middlesbrough five months ago after being kicked out of their accommodation.</p><p>The young girl admits she’s never had more than £700 and has been attacked while on the streets.</p><p>Demi and Aaron met in care and reveal they have had two kids together; one who died and they also have a five-month-old baby who was taken by social services.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000488294757.jpg><p>Aaron tells Bobby: “All we want to do is have our kid with us.”</p><p>And when the heartbroken mum is asked why they have been homeless for so long, she replies: “We've tried [to get off the streets].</p><p>“And when you've tried for so long you sort of give up.</p><p>“I had to give [my daughter] to the midwife, I had to. I didn't want to do it, I wanted her to stay with us.</p><p>“We could have given her the world if they'd given us the change. Now they've taken our work away from us and what have we got now?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000488293598.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Rich Kids Go Homeless - Billionaire's son Bobby Misner meets rough sleeper who tells him one of his children died and the other is in care</span><p>At the end of the three days, a taxi comes to take a changed Bobby back to his life of luxury.</p><p>He said the experience has helped him realise how hard it is to get off the streets and says it was “one of the toughest things he has done”.</p><p>He admits: “I was slightly guilty of being a little prejudiced before.</p><p>“I'm going to be so grateful for the things in my life, and I'm not going to take anything for granted.”</p><p>It is later revealed that the trio are still in contact and the couple have visited Bobby, who gave them a makeover.</p><p><strong>Rich Kids Go Homeless airs at 9pm on 5Star this Wednesday.</strong></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p>We previously shared how a <a href=# rel>millionaire trader, 22, is nearly stabbed and has to bathe in McDonalds as he swaps his lavish lifestyle for sleeping on the streets in Rich Kids Go Homeless.</a></p><p>And a <a href=# rel>Rich Kid who rakes in £10,000-a-day and thinks homeless are ‘lazy’ was stabbed in his own home.</a></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Self-made millionaire reveals he spent £4,500 on his teeth on Rich Kids Go Homeless</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5hpaW9rZW58o7XLpaCoppGev6Z50qilZqKVqXqpu8yeo56ro2K9prvPpZxmpJGvxm6yzquYoJ1dl7avv4yroJygXaC2pb%2BMoKZmoJ%2Bisq2x0qxm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./marcus-lattimore.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Marcus Lattimore net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
