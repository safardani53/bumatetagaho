I would say she is now a bit more toned and lithe but she has retained the good parts. You would do a double take at the beach from both back and front.</p><p>He goes on to describe her as a Katy Perry lookalike, with excellent people skills and a warm and friendly personality.</p><p>Andrea's review of him, is rather less flattering.</p><p>"Mr. CEO looked like a bloated old fish stick with warts all over his face and body," she writes in her book.</p><p>"We never had sex," she continues. Mr. CEO could not physically sustain a boner<br>long enough to have sex, nor could he ejaculate."<br></p><h2>'Her legs were not memorable as they are fairly short'</h2><p>Another client, Don Juan, posted a three-page review of his time with Andrea - which sounds like an excerpt from Fifty Shades of Grey.</p><p>"My tongue was in her mouth, her tongue in mine, each of us sucking on each other’s<br>tongues, our tongues meeting outside of our mouths. She is absolutely a fabulous kisser in every respect," one line read.</p><p>Andrea is quick to bring Don Juan back to reality in her book, where she reveals most of his erotic writing is actually a lie.</p><p>But not all reviews are quite as flattering as Don and Mr CEO's.</p><p>One user commented on Andrea: "Her legs were not memorable as they are fairly short."<br></p><h2>Raped for a good review</h2><p>And bad reviews can put sex workers in danger.</p><p>As Andrea says: "There’s nothing stopping a man&nbsp;from fabricating a bad review, be it out of boredom or out of spite.<br>"A bad review for a sex worker can have serious implications: beyond damaging her hard-won reputation, it can also destroy her business by dissuading both new and returning clients.</p><p>"If a client has a chip on his shoulder because a sex worker has declined, for instance, to do anal when maybe she’s agreed to do it in the past, the client-cum-critic can easily say, 'If we don’t do anal, I’ll have to write a bad review.'</p><p>"This puts the already vulnerable sex worker in a difficult position: say no to anal and bye-bye to her business, or say yes and get raped for a good review."<br></p><h2>Personal hygiene problems</h2><p>Andrea admits that most of her encounters were far from glamorous - with personal hygiene occasionally being a serious problem.</p><p><span>Speaking about the beginning of her career Andrea said: “</span><span>The men I’d serviced, on the whole, were clean and professional gentlemen not above giving their junk a rinse before inviting a beautiful lady over for a $260 hour of sex."</span></p><p>However this all changed one day with one new client in a basement apartment, with Andrea explaining: "In silence he looked at me, sliding off his sweatpants, revealing a small penis surrounded by thick stubble. A quick preliminary whiff of his d**k conveyed notes of cheese and black mould."<br></p><h2>'No one deserves to be raped'</h2><p>Despite the entertaining and tongue-in-cheek stories, there is also a serious message behind the book.</p><p>Revealing the dark side of the industry, Andrea - who says she enjoyed connecting with strangers on "a deep level" - also recalls her feelings of shame when she was raped out of the blue by regular client Walt.</p><p>Describing the incident she said: "Relentlessly and with unseen fierceness, he pounded my painfully contorted body as hard as ever. Whether it was fear or guilt or shame or duty that kept me there I don't know, but I stayed."</p><p>She added: "Everything I knew about rape culture told me prostitutes get raped because they put themselves in sexually vulnerable positions for money.</p><p>"So by putting myself in a vulnerable position, [I felt] it was my fault Walter Wack raped me.</p><p>"No one deserves to be raped. No one."</p><p>The former sex worker also hopes her book will contribute to the important discussion around the #MeToo movement, telling the Guardian: "I think it's a really good time to talk about sex work because we're talking about sex more openly - sexual abuse, harrassment and rape.</p><p>"I actually think we're in a place where the more critically minded of us can confront these issues head-on."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Latest News:</h2></p><p>Now, Andrea works as as peer outreach worker for sex workers rights organisation Maggie's Toronto, and is also a writer and performer, and while she has put her sex work behind her, she insists she isn't ashamed of her decision, and included the word w***e in the title of her book to re-appropriate the the term.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfrLyzuMOnnLCrX2yBeISUam5onaOYvLPA0mapmqyVmXq1vsipmJ2umai8s3s%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./are-michael-keaton-and-diane-keaton-related.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are Michael Keaton and Diane Keaton Related?
