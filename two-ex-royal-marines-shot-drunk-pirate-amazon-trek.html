He had a face full of malice though."</p><p>John added: "As we went to leave, he manoeuvred to basically hold onto the back of our boat."</p><p>The pair then told of their incredible fight for their lives on the open water as they battled the gun-toting pirates with their paddles.</p><p>John continued: " Yan thrust the paddle straight into the guy's chest to disarm him, and then he dived into the water to capsize them.</p><p>"It all happened so quickly, but then I boarded his boat. I think I grabbed him, and there were two shots.</p><p>"The first shot was aimed at Yan and missed. The second shot hit me in the shoulder. Then I was in the water.</p><p>"When I eventually came up, Yan was tussling with him. He had come up on the other side and pulled their boat down to try and capsize them."</p><p>Their attackers' boat began to flood with water, while John miraculously managed to pull the remaining pirate into the sea.</p><p>He continued: "I finished the capsize and grabbed the lad at the same time. I vividly remember then having my hand on top of his head - basically trying to drown him.</p><p>"Then, the third shot went off and I felt another jolt through my whole body.</p><h2>'WE SWAM LIKE HELL'</h2><p>"I thought in my head 'this can't happen again' and found his arm with my hand, and luckily found his weapon.</p><p>"As I twisted the weapon out of his hand, I fired two shots underwater in the struggle and then it jammed - having the weapon in my control, I then knew that there was no longer a threat.</p><p>"I came up from the water, and the guy surfaced about two metres away from me. We then swam like hell to our boat - about 15 metres away."</p><p>Ian described their return to the boat as "the scariest moment", as they feared other pirates could wade in for backup.</p><p>He said: "It's very easy to drop into the line of how terrible it could have been, which it could have been, but also it could not have happened at all.</p><p>"We were very unlucky to have that experience at all - but ultimately what we did saved our lives."</p><p>The pair paddled towards a nearby village for help, where locals rushed to their aid, while frantically trying to send an SOS message.</p><p>They used their Garmin InReach2 device to alert authorities, seeing a Peruvian naval gunboat swoop in to rescue them three hours later.</p><p>Their attackers were later arrested by local <a href=#>police</a> and one had to undergo surgery as it emerged he had also been shot in the hip.</p><h2>HELD HOSTAGE</h2><p>But this wasn't John and Ian's first brush with death on their mammoth expedition along the Amazon - as they were kidnapped by reclusive tribes TWICE.</p><p>The Marines said they were earlier "abducted" by villagers after crossing into <a href=#>Peru</a>, where they had been warned locals don't take tourists well.</p><p>Ian, from Exeter, <a href=#>Devon</a>, who now works in security and property management, said they were "essentially detained" by the first community they ran into.</p><p>He explained: "Some young men lassoed our boat to the shore, and were pretty worried about us being there."</p><p>The pair had to negotiate with the locals using "broken Spanish" as the group argued over their fate.</p><p>John added: "We were kind of just sitting there as the villagers and elders debated between each other thinking 'so are we going to be stoned to death, or let go'.</p><p>"After it happened once, we were more used to it. But the first time it was a strange experience.</p><p>"We didn't expect to have two-legged problems, we expected eight-legged issues with spiders. We actually had no issues with nature really."</p><p>The pals were later held up by another isolated tribe - but again miraculously managed to wrangle their way to freedom.</p><p>However, their latest attack has forced them to abandon their world-first expedition which first began in late April - for now.</p><p>We didn't expect to have two-legged problems, we expected eight-legged issues with spiders</p><span class=quote-credit>John Bathgate</span><p>The marines had hoped the adventure, inspired by John's dad, could help them fundraise for a string of charities close to their hearts.</p><p>The duo planned to raise cash for the Royal Marines Charity, Rainforest Concern and several other mental-health charities.</p><p>Their epic journey, sponsored by outdoor company Tiso, would have carried them a record-breaking 5,128km to Bel√©m in Brazil.</p><p>But they had to call time on their adventure around 200km from the Brazilian border.</p><p>John and Ian returned home in early August and quickly began planning their return - but say they now intend to take a few more thrill seekers with them.</p><p>The marine turned rope access technician added: "We discussed it afterwards, with beers, and the best thing to do really was come back and reassure our families.</p><p>"The incident hadn't had an adverse effect on us, but returning to see terrified <a href=#>Whatsapp</a> messages from everyone made us realise we needed to leave.</p><p>"Also, my arm isn't really working - so I needed to see an orthopaedic specialist. But we're not abandoning it, we're just postponing."</p><p>John and Ian said their first point of call will be the small community who offered them aid after their clash with the pirates.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>They plan to return with armfuls of "thank you gifts" to show their appreciation.</p><p>"When we go back completely depends on <a href=#>fundraising</a>, but I think we're both itching to get to the finish line," John said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kidnapped-shot-pirates-intrepid-ex-838105006.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kidnapped-shot-pirates-intrepid-ex-838105054.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4B1hZVqbnJnpKy8brHXZqmosZGheq6t0aKlnqtdqLWwwIydqa6mm2K9qr7ArZxmmZ2Wx7C6jK2pnqNf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chip-hoch.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chip Hoch- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Ethnicity">&larr;
