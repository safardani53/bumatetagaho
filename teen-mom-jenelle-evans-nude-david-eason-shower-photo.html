If that was his favorite, it says a lot about their current situation."</p><p>Another wrote: "If you don't know Jenelle and David and their background, it's a bomb a** picture. But the fact it is them, this seems like a dig because she isn't that size anymore."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>A third posted: "David alternates between posting humiliating pictures/videos to posting a nude of her but back when she was 'skinny' so she feels trapped.</p><p>"It will simultaneously boost her ego and send her current body image into the dumpster knowing her husband find 2+ years old photos of her hot.</p><p>They finished: "Sad and creepy overall."</p><p>A fourth said: "She looks great, but it is very concerning David thinks he has the right to post such an intimate photo of Jenelle."</p><p>A fifth wrote: "And people still wanna fight with me and tell me that he doesn't post this stuff to degrade her or claim ownership. Is this good enough?"</p><h2>BATTLING BODY IMAGE</h2><p>Jenelle revealed her <a href=#>true feelings about her body</a> while reminiscing over her thinner figure in a series of throwback photos.</p><p>She got vulnerable with her fans on TikTok, confessing that she is insecure about her curves and misses the way she used to look.</p><p>In the clip, the 29-year-old lip synched to the song Sexy B**ch by David Guetta as she disclosed her thoughts in the caption.</p><p>While smiling at the camera, she wrote: "When I feel bad about how I look, and forget who I am."</p><p>The clip then flashes to a group of photos of the star from her younger years, showing off her flat abs and toned arms.</p><p>The video concluded with Jenelle looking shocked as she covered her mouth with her hand, before waving her hand in front of her face.</p><p>The TikTok post included the caption: "Sometimes I look back and think [hot]".</p><p>Mom of three Jenelle had a much different&nbsp;<a href=#>reaction towards her curvy frame</a>&nbsp;last week, when she recorded a TikTok video in celebration of her behind.</p><p>In the video, the young mom lip synced over an artist saying "Cheer if I have a fat a**."</p><p>üçº&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Follow all our latest news & stories on&nbsp;Teen Mo</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a>&nbsp;then switches to a screen of dozens of mirrored images of Jenelle, all cheering her on.</p><p>The ex TV star captioned the video "Cheering myself on."</p><h2>'GLOWING AND GORGEOUS'</h2><p>Jenelle shared a TikTok showing herself <a href=#>shaking her butt and eating Oreos</a> after she admitted she "feels bad" about her fuller figure.</p><p>Text over the snarky clip read: "When people say 'she really let herself go'..."</p><p>Jenelle&nbsp;included audio of singer Rihanna addressing societies beauty standards, saying: "I love seeing women feel empowered, and especially women who are thick 'cause society don't want you to live your best life when you're thick, but they just make you wanna be thick.</p><p>"I love them girls."</p><p>The embattled reality star captioned the clip: "I love @rihanna so much."</p><p>Fans flooded the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">comments</a>&nbsp;with compliments for Jenelle, praising her body positive message.</p><p>One commenter wrote: "She‚Äôs literally a normal size and ppl shame her for it which is shocking" to which Jenelle replied, "Thanks Mama Tot."</p><p>Another commenter said of the star: "helllll no you look the happiest you've ever been and it looks good on you."</p><p>A third TikTok user chimed in: "you look healthy asf and you look so much happy."</p><p>Another agreed, writing: "let yourself go? you are literally glowing and gorgeous."</p><h2>HARD PASS</h2><p>Recently, Jenelle told fans "it's better" that she didn't attend the upcoming reunion special Teen Mom: Family Reunion but scoffed at the fact producers extended an invitation to Farrah Abraham who was fired over working in the porn industry.</p><p>She was asked if she'd be at the upcoming&nbsp;Teen Mom OG&nbsp;and Teen Mom 2 crossover reunion special.</p><p>Jenelle launched into a lengthy tirade about the show, saying: "Yeah, about that...I already have a whole YouTube video explaining this. It's from, like, a couple months back.</p><p>"Basically, I got called one day by my old producer. He asked me if I wanted to be a part of this Teen Mom reunion show thing. I said, 'I'm up for it, you can let them know I'm up for it, but I just want my husband [David Eason] there as support...Maybe down the street, staying at a different hotel, just in case if s**t pops off I have somewhere to go and support.'</p><p>She went on: "Once I told them that, I never got a call back about it and I was basically ignored.</p><p>"So, yes, I was invited, but I guess then I was uninvited. And apparently all the girls are scared of me because they're like, 'Oh hell no, we don't want Jenelle being here.'"</p><p>Jenelle&nbsp;went on to say: "But pretty much all the other Teen Moms are there, including Farrah, so have fun watching them."</p><p>She noted that it wasn't entirely bad, saying: "With my anxiety being so bad lately, it's probably best I didn't go."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Her reunion reveal comes amid&nbsp;<a href=#>backlash over a TikTok video</a>&nbsp;she posted about her health.</p><p>After opening up about her anxiety, Jenelle shared a lighthearted video after claiming she could become "paralyzed" due to a cyst on her spine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000699650693.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000682839262.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000690489892-1.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Teen Mom Jenelle Evans shakes her butt while eating Oreos after star admitted she ‚Äòfeels bad‚Äô about her fuller figure</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGlnZX51hZZyZq2dlaN6rrvMZqGeppWhuaZ5xK%2BYp6tdo8KlsYydmK%2BhlGKyor%2FOp2SsoJ%2BssrN5z6Gmradf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bob-the-builder-classic.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bob the Builder Classic - Watch on Paramount Plus">&larr;
