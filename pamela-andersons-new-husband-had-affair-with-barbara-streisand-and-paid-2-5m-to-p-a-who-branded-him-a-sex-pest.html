He is the monster.”</p><p>And before all that drama, who can forget her strange relationship with WikiLeaks weirdo Julian Assange?</p><p>She smuggled vegan food into the Ecuadorian embassy in London where the activist was holed up and said cryptically: “Everyone deserves love.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000556652440.jpg><p>Now she is hitched to a Hollywood bigwig 22 years her senior who once had an affair with Barbra Streisand, has been addicted to painkillers and faced a string of bullying and sex harassment claims.</p><p>So who is Jon Peters, the man given the nickname “the original Hollywood bad boy”?</p><p>The 74-year-old native of Beverly Hills played a child riding a donkey in 1956 film The Ten Commandments.</p><p>But Peters was not so angelic in reality, dropping out of school at 13 and doing a stint in a youth detention centre.</p><p>He was sent to live with two male guardians in New York — but, fearing they would molest him, he crept out of a window and slept rough for a while.</p><p>His first job was as a “muff dyer” for sex workers.</p><h2>'MUFF DRYER'</h2><p>He explained: “The prostitutes had red hair, red pubic hair and red poodles. I made it so everything matched.”</p><p>Like Pammi, Jon has been married four times previously, the first — to Henrietta Zampitella — before he turned 17.</p><p>He went into the family hairdressing business, running a chain of salons in California before opening a shop on LA’s famous Rodeo Drive.</p><p>His second wife, Lesley Ann Warren — with whom he has a son, Christopher — said his ­tactic to attract showbiz stars was to fib in the papers about cutting their hair.</p><p>She said: “Then he would meet them and they would fall in love with him, and he would do their hair.”</p><p>In 1973, Barbra Streisand asked him to make her a wig for her movie For Pete’s Sake, which sparked an often tempestuous 12-year affair.</p><p>Jon, who split with Lesley Ann in 1974, said of one fight: “Barbra sat on my chest and spat at me. I spat back.”</p><p>He produced her album Butterfly and steered her into acting, most notably in the 1976 version of A Star Is Born, which he produced.</p><p>The role bagged Streisand an Oscar for original song and a Golden Globe for best actress. The Funny Girl legend is godmother to Jon’s daughter Caleigh.</p><p>In 30 years, our age difference won’t mean so much.</p><p>He said of Streisand: “She was the most captivating, interesting, creative person I ever met. I will always owe her for giving me the life I’ve had.”</p><p>In 1989, he launched the Batman movie franchise and admits to having an affair with movie beauty Kim Basinger, who was then married to make-up artist Ron Snyder.</p><p>But it was Pammi who he took to the first film’s red-carpet premiere in 1989.</p><p>He remembers their first meeting at the Playboy mansion, saying: “I walked in and saw this little angel sitting at the bar. It was Pammi. She was like 19. I knew she would be a big star.”</p><p>Jon was 41 but the pair dated and lived together. He paid for acting, dance and voice classes which paved the way for her performing career.</p><p>But his advice not to pose for Hugh Hefner’s Playboy magazine fell on deaf ears.</p><p>Jon said: “Of course, Hefner loved her and saw her beauty. Pamela was a girl who with no make-up was gorgeous. She was very smart and talented.”</p><p>She rejected Peters’ marriage proposal, but he remembers telling her: “In 30 years, our age difference won’t mean so much.”</p><p>I picked her up many times from her lawyer’s office and flew her up with her kids and hid her out in Aspen for a month because the guy was beating her up.</p><p>In 1992, she landed the role of CJ Parker on Baywatch and became a global pin-up.</p><p>Marriage followed, with her first husband Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, who she wed just 96 hours after their first date.</p><p>During their three-year relationship, a home-made sex tape was stolen and put online, she contracted Hepatitis C from sharing his tattoo needle and Tommy was sent to prison for ­domestic violence.</p><p>All the while, Jon was ­waiting to offer sanctuary.</p><p>He said: “I picked her up many times from her lawyer’s office and flew her up with her kids and hid her out in Aspen for a month because the guy was beating her up.”</p><p>Meanwhile Jon’s career had suffered a big setback.</p><p>In 1991, he was axed as co-chairman of Sony’s Columbia Pictures. His two-year tenure, alongside partner Peter Guber, allegedly cost Sony more than £2.2billion.</p><p>Stories of excess include Jon taking the corporate jet to deliver flowers to model Vendela Kirsebom, and whisking Jack Nicholson off on a drug and prostitute- fuelled romp around London to tempt him into playing the Joker in Batman.</p><h2>'AS GRAND AS POSSIBLE'</h2><p>It is claimed in the book Hit & Run, by Nancy Griffin and Kim Masters, he and Guber poured “hundreds of millions” of company money into making its HQ “as grand as possible”, including installing a giant stereo system.</p><p>Two more failed marriages and three daughters followed.</p><p>After his split from fourth wife Mindy Williamson in 2004, Peters was given a restraining order due to his “abusive” behaviour.</p><p>A knee injury saw him spiral into painkiller addiction, which he then replaced with a marijuana habit.</p><p>But relaunching the Superman movies earned him around £62million.</p><p>In 2011, former personal assistant Shelly Morita accused him of exposing himself to her in front of her two-year-old daughter and claimed he often groped her.</p><p>Morita also alleged he jumped into her bed during filming of Superman Returns in 2006.</p><p>Peters denied all the claims but lost the case and was ordered to pay more than £2.5million in damages.</p><p>Four other cases were settled out of court, with Peters denying any wrongdoing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000377759214-1-e1579826231881.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000556655772.jpg><p>The claims resurfaced in online magazine Jezebel ahead of the 2018 remake of A Star Is Born.</p><p>Producers of the 2018 movie were contractually obliged to credit Peters but he was not involved in doing publicity for the film.</p><p>Bradley Cooper, who directed and starred in the hit film with Lady Gaga, said: “If I had known all those things, I would have done it differently.”</p><p>Since 2013, Peters has lived a reclusive life at his 3,000-acre ranch in Santa Barbara.</p><p>He revealed three years ago that his daily routine involved waking up at 5.30am, playing the stock market, having lunch with friends like actor Jack Nicholson and going to bed by 7.30pm.</p><p>He said: “Everybody’s ­reclusive when you make a certain amount of money.”</p><p>Pammi has also had her share of ups and downs, not just with the size of her surgically altered boobs.</p><p>Two more marriages followed Kid Rock — both times to poker player Rick Salomon, best-known for his sex tape with Paris Hilton.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000500779588-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000301521311-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000500501612-2.jpg><p>The acting has more or less dried up, but she has reshaped her career with regular appearances on US chat shows as well as pouring her energy into animal rights and environmental activism.</p><p>Ten years ago, she found herself living in a mobile home on a trailer park. The mum of two was reported to have racked up debts of around £1million from luxury renovation projects, although she dismissed the “talk of debt and bankruptcy” as “garbage”.</p><p>She has appeared on the French version of Strictly and in 2013 was the first celeb booted off Dancing On Ice.</p><p>Now her fortunes and her love life are looking much more peachy.</p><p>She and Jon married on Tuesday in front of her sons from her marriage to Tommy — Brandon, 23, and Dylan, 22 — Jon’s children and even his second wife Christine.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TV AND SHOWBIZ</h2></p><p>Jon said: “For 35 years, I’ve only wanted Pamela.”</p><p>And Pammi wrote in a poem: “He’s been there all along. I’m ready now and he’s ready too.”</p><p>Let’s hope the tide has finally turned for her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000556651973.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000500776057-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000556283153.jpg><h2>Her other ex hubbys</h2><p><strong>Feb 1995-Feb 1998: Tommy Lee, Mötley Crüe drummer.
