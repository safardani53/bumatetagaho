They want to go for a drink or a meal before progressing to sex and they can be seeking an emotional connection.”</p><p>Here, <b>DIANA APPLEYARD </b>speaks to four women who pay for sex — and a male escort who explains why he is in such high demand.</p><h2>Gweneth, 48, spent £1,500</h2><p><b>BUSINESS consultant Gweneth Lee uses gigolos because she loves sex but hates listening to dates droning on about themselves.</b></p><p><b>Her spend includes the escorts as well as hotel rooms for their meetings. Single Gweneth, who divides her time between homes in central London and in the US, says:</b></p><p>I hired my first male escort recently after my long-term partner died, and I will definitely do it again. I did it mostly for the thrill, just to see what they were like.</p><p>I fly a lot between London and America and I found my first male escort through an advertisement in an international newspaper.</p><p>I have a very high libido but I didn’t want to deal with the baggage that most men bring to a relationship.</p><p>Sometimes a girl just wants to get laid without the complications of having to listen to some guy tell you his entire life story or boast about all his previous conquests. There are no worries about whether he will call or how many other women he is seeing. If I choose to see him again, I just have to pick up the phone.</p><p>It costs me about £250 for two hours and I know that whenever I want a man, I can pick one from an advert.</p><p>More businesswomen like me are using escorts because it’s so easy and uncomplicated.</p><p>I’ve got too much on my plate to be dealing with a man who’s needy and wants drama. I just want great sex, and then to say goodbye.</p><h2>Charlotte, 34, spent £480</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2527090.main_image.jpg><p><b>WRITER and broadcaster Charlotte Rose has enjoyed the services of escorts twice — because she thinks one-night stands are sleazy.</b></p><p><b>The single mother, who campaigns for the rights of sex workers, lives in East London. She says:</b></p><p>I first used a male escort three years ago for the very simple reason that I was horny.</p><p>I’m a single woman and I really do not like the idea of trawling for men in bars. One-night stands are sleazy.</p><p>By hiring a male escort it’s a simple, clean transaction and everyone knows what they are getting.</p><p>I also want to meet a man who knows what he is doing when it comes down to sex. Being frank, a lot more women are turning to male escorts because they find men their own age are crap in bed.</p><p>The first male escort I booked was in Devon, and he cost me £140 for two hours.</p><p>The second guy was in London and he cost me £340 for three hours — but it was well worth it.</p><p>I booked him because he offered a 20-minute free massage with his services. I was looking to ‘swoon’, I wanted the full romantic package.</p><p>With the London guy, we went for a pint together after the sex and got on great.</p><p>With both of them the sex was mind-blowing because, frankly, they were there to please me.</p><p>It’s a selfish experience but men have been doing it for years and I believe that it is now high time women got into the action.</p><h2>Karen, 47, spent £2,500</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2527091.main_image.jpg><p><b>DIVORCEE Karen Stewart has so far enjoyed 12 romps with the same escort, paying for hotels as well as his services.</b></p><p><b>She runs a head-hunting agency and lives in Southampton. Karen, who has no children, says:</b></p><p>As the boredom of being divorced and alone set in, I wondered how on earth I was ever going to meet someone.</p><p>I didn’t want sex with a man my age — they’re too boring and selfish. I wanted to experience the pleasure of having sex with a young man.</p><p>What I was looking for was no-strings sex, so I started researching on the internet.</p><p>The hardest thing is knowing who to choose. Quite a lot of them have pictures of themselves without their shirts on, so that helps.</p><p>Once I’d made my choice we spoke on the phone. I told him I had ‘a desire to experiment’, and said that would be no problem.</p><p>He took charge and it was clear he knew exactly what he was doing. The sex was the most incredible of my life, he had absolutely no inhibitions. He said he only did this part time, he was also a policeman, which added to the thrill.</p><p>I loved it so much that I saw him on and off, always on a paid basis, for a year. It has certainly put a big smile on my face.</p><h2>Jules, 48, spent £2,700</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2527092.main_image.jpg><p><b>LAB technician Jules Fox has treated herself to an escort around three times a year for the past three years, at £300 a time. The single mum, from South London, says:</b></p><p>I started seeing escorts when my relationship broke down. The desire comes from the thrill of meeting someone new, a stranger, and I love the element of control.</p><p>Looking for a male escort gives you all the power. The kind of guy I go for is strong, young and masculine. I have a weakness for men in uniforms.</p><p>Booking a male escort is so easy — you just look at the profiles on the internet and ring their mobile.</p><p>People might say that I am an attractive woman who could have my pick of men. But I’m very busy and being able to book male escorts online makes life so much easier.</p><p>With all the escorts I’ve used, I go to their home. I’ve never had a bad experience.</p><p>I always chat to them on the phone first, to get a sense of who they are. You can tell a lot from the sound of someone’s voice.</p><h2>Ladies show me off</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2527093.main_image.jpg><p><b>MODEL-turned-escort Matteo DelToro advertises himself as “passionate” “gallant” and “sweet” — and also boasts that he is “a great listener”.</b></p><p><b>The Italian-born 29-year-old, who lives in Tower Hamlets, East London, says his clients mostly want companionship, but a third opt for sex. He explains:</b></p><p>I advertise on various websites and in local newspapers.</p><p>As well as being a very successful male escort I work as a life coach.</p><p>I see my role as entertaining women. I charge £100 an hour, and my role is not all about sex — I accompany women to the opera, to the theatre, to parties and out for dinner.</p><p>Often these women want a handsome man on their arm, and I have been introduced as a “boyfriend”.</p><p>Then, if sex happens at the end of the evening, that is lovely.</p><p>The women who hire me range in age from 28 to 50 — most are attractive, but some are not. In that situation, I look for an attractive side to their personality.</p><p>Most are single, a few are married.</p><p>The reasons women book me are many and varied — they to impress their colleagues, they want a night of wonderful sex, or sometimes they want to make their boyfriends jealous.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FvaG5pZ2TEpnnPmrBmn5mcvK270madqKpdqLK5ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./colton-dixon-teams-up-with-charity-for-build-a-boat-music-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Colton Dixon Teams Up with Charity for 'Build a Boat' Music Video">&larr;
