I have an unusual amount of energy. I think she probably hoped by dating an older man she’d be bothered less than she is.”</p><p>He continued to tell The Sun that he “doesn’t know what’s going on,” adding: “I’m hornier than a rhino, only for her obviously. We’re just really into each other and we go out&nbsp;a lot and it makes people want to throw up when we’re all over each other.</p><p>“We’ve been married nine years in May. I’d never been single before and couldn’t get a kiss. I left school without kissing a girl. I’m 5ft10 and talk a lot. I was so bad at being single.”</p><p>Lindsey caught his eye in the front row of one of his shows, and he incorporated her into one of his routines, eventually asking her out.</p><p>The pair dated for 18 months before marrying in a private ceremony in Spain.</p><p>And the Steph’s Packed Lunch star keeps his doting fans hooked on social media with his hilarious videos, some of which he films with wife Lindsey.</p><p>But comedy was never originally on the cards for Russell, who was happy working as a copywriter before things kicked off.</p><p>He explained: “I never planned my comedy career. When I first got my first writing job as a copywriter someone said ‘you’re so funny’ which was something I’d been told my whole life but no one ever said to do anything with it. I thought it wasn’t a transferable skill to be funny but turns out it is.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>“I was sat in an office and I was sat at my copywriting desk and a colleague said ‘please just try comedy Russell you’ll be f***** ace at it I know it.’</p><p>“So I googled stand-up comedy and clicked the first link and phoned the first number and asked how it worked. It was as simple as that.</p><p>“There was a three week wait and you go to amateur night and have a five minute slot. I had never been to see live stand up at this point, so in the three weeks that I was waiting I went to watch some and thought ‘I think I’m funny as some of these.’ The rest is history.”</p><p>Before his comedy debut, Russell described himself as a “bit of a show off,” and said he’d had small parts in Grange Hill and The Bill.</p><p>Since soaring to succss, the stand-up comedian won the Laughing Horse New Act of the Year in 2004 and a year later came second place in comedy competition So You Think You're Funny.</p><p>He has been nominated for two Edinburgh Comedy Awards - first in 2009 and then the following year when he won the gong.</p><p>He’s gone on to present I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here Now alongside Laura Whitmore and Joe Swash between 2009-11 .</p><p>He has also presented Freak Like Me on BBC3 in 2010 as well as Geordie Shore: The Reunion for MTV in 2012.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>His latest project is a podcast named Pack Your Bags, which sees the comic and some very special guests heading off on an adventure.</p><p>Over the 12 episodes Russell&nbsp;jets off with well known travel-lovers from the worlds of sport, food, science and entertainment as they surprise&nbsp;him&nbsp;with their three must-pack travel items.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/b1daf7e2-0221-406b-8f1c-e75fb32e388c.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSEd4OUbW5sZ6KqwLSxy6VkpJmemnqiusNmrqKelWLAsHnHqKmnsV2lsrC8y55kmqqVYsCqr8po</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rebecca-ryan-and-dan-acraman-are-expecting-their-first-child.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rebecca Ryan And Dan Acraman Are Expecting Their First Child">&larr;
