Partners in real life for more than 17 years, the couple were also the partners in crime&nbsp;for one of HGTV’s most popular shows called Fixer Upper, a show for home designing and renovation enthusiasts based in Waco Texas.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The partnership, however, came crashing down as the rumor of their divorce spread like wildfire on the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">internet</a>&nbsp;back in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>But how much truth did the rumors carry? Find out about the answers to the above questions and more, in these riveting wikis&nbsp;revealing her bio, her love story with Chip, and their divorce talks. Also know more about the scandals concerning their show, Fixer Upper.</p><h2>Joanna Gaines Is American Nationality But Embraces Mixed Ethnicity</h2><p>Joanna Gaines was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born</a> on April 19, 1978, in Kansas, Texas, as Joanna Lea Stevens. The 42-years-old reality star&nbsp;possesses American&nbsp;nationality. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That being said, she&nbsp;comes from a mixed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ethnicity</a> with her roots tracing back to Lebanon, Germany, and Korea. Her mother was Korean and her father was half German and half Lebanese.</p><p>Being raised in&nbsp;Texas, she graduated from Baylor University with a degree in communications.</p><h2>Joanna And Her Husband Chip Gaines Graduated From The Same University&nbsp;</h2><p>Both Joanna and her husband&nbsp;Chip <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">graduated</a> from Baylor University, but&nbsp;three years apart. Chip graduated in 1998 with a marketing degree whereas Joanna graduated in 2001. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Having never met at college, they <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met</a> for the first time in Waco in 2001 when Chip took his vehicle for inspection at an auto shop called Jerry Stevens Firestone. Although he had been a loyal customer of that store for some time, it was the first time he saw Joanna working at the shop.</p><p>Afterward, the two sat outside the auto shop and talked for 30 minutes. The following day, Chip called Joanna and asked her out. They started dating in 2001.</p><h2>Joanna Got Engaged With Chip in 2002</h2><p>After dating and falling in love with one another, Chip <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">proposed</a> to Joanna in 2002. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On the day he proposed to Joanna, he told her that they were going to a private concert four hours away from Waco. But he surprised her as he took her to a shopping center in the neighborhood where his parents grew up and got down on one knee.</p><p>After she said 'Yes,' Chip took Joanna to a jewelry store to let her design her own engagement ring.</p><p>I was able to pick out a nice round diamond and a beautiful, antique-looking platinum setting. I had a blast sitting there with Billy, designing the perfect ring. Chip just sat there, patiently observing every second of it.</p><p>-&nbsp;Joanna told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Magnolia Story</a></p><h2>Joanna&nbsp;& Husband Chip Worked Together In A Show After Marriage</h2><p>About a year later, Joanna <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a>&nbsp;Chip in the Earle Harrison House in Waco, Texas, on May 31, 2003. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After their honeymoon, Joanna ventured alongside her husband in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">career</a> of house decoration. Then, the two flipped and moved into their new home in Waco. Soon after moving into their new home, the redesign enthusiast couple started their first redesigning store, Magnolia Market.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;As their business thrived, Joana also started blogging about redesigns to satisfy the demands of sit-at-home enthusiasts. As her website reached more users, she was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">approached</a> in 2013 by HGTV producers to start their own show.</p><p>Unable to believe that the call was true, Joana's husband classified the call as a hoax, however, she believed there was a bit of truth in it and approached the producers. And the rest is history. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Fixer Upper's Pilot Aired In 2013</h2><p>After making sure that the show was for real, the husband-wife duo's pilot of the show <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fixer Upper</a> aired in 2013. The show that featured remodeling old and abandoned homes into&nbsp;new-like livable abodes turned out to be a huge hit and was picked up by HGTV to be a regular in the network.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of the show based in Waco, Texas, the celebrity restoration couple has restored numerous abandoned homes into shiny residential places. The couple's show, however, has not been far from controversy as they have regularly featured in news for various reasons.</p><p>The most high profile claims came from their business partners who helped them open up the Magnolia market. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Joanna and Chip were sued by their former business partners who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">alleged</a> that the Gaineses had persuaded them to sell their interest in Magnolia Realty to them for $2,500 each without disclosing their plans about the development of the reality television show, Fixer Upper.</p><p>His attorney, Jordan Mayfield, told CBS’s network KWTX-TV, in Waco, Texas, “We are confident that these claims will be found to be meritless, and it is disappointing to see people try to take advantage of the hard work and success of Chip and Joanna Gaines."</p><p>The claims were later brushed off by authorities as baseless. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Joanna And Chip's Divorce Rumors Are False</h2><p>In 2017, Joanna and Chip’s marriage was supposedly&nbsp;in a crisis, according to various <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>. Various wiki sites had been reporting that Joana and her husband had decided to separate and had even filed for a divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the couple put on a united display to kill&nbsp;off those rumors. On September 14, 2017, they sat down with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ET Canada</a>&nbsp;and responded to the divorce stories with a resounding “no” from both partners. Not just that, they also reiterated their wedding vows and sang hymns from the same sheet claiming that the couple were focused on raising their five children and had no time to respond to the baseless rumors.</p><h2>Joanna And Her Husband Are Together With Five Children</h2><p>Amidst the reports of divorce, the couple celebrated hitting a new landmark in 2018.&nbsp;On June 1, 2018, Joanna and her husband <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">celebrated</a> a massive fifteen years of marriage. As of 2020, they have been married for over 17&nbsp; years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In these 17 years, the husband-wife duo has welcomed five <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">children</a> named Drake, Ella, Duke, Emmie, and Crew. All of whom make routine appearances on Joanna's as well as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chip's</a> social media handles, spending time together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGilnq%2BjZLewrc2nmGafkZ67pr%2BMm6CoZaeeuKp5wKCcZ6Ckork%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./johnny-depp-and-camille-vasquez-have-generated-baseless-relationship-rumors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Johnny Depp and Camille Vasquez Have Generated Baseless Relationship Rumors">&larr;
