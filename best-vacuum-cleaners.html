But with so many vacuums on the market — from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>upright vacuums</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>robot vacuums</a> — how are you supposed to know which one is perfect for you?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Shyam Joshi, MD and CMO of Nectar finds HEPA filters and model type (i.e. bagged or bagless) to be one of the most important aspects of anyone's vacuum search. "Either type of vacuum is reasonable if used with an appropriately designed HEPA filter and seal, thus reducing the risk of contaminants escaping into the air when vacuuming," he explains. While size, price, dust bin capacity, and attachments are extra components to consider, this is one to keep top of mind throughout the process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested over 300 vacuums in our lab and at home to determine how easy they were to set up, their effectiveness, maneuverability, ease of emptying, noise level, versatility, and portability. We also tested each vacuum on several types of floors (including hardwood floors and high-pile carpets). Then, we evaluated how many passes it took to suction up different items, such as popcorn kernels, Cheerios, and hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Read more about the best vacuums PEOPLE Tested.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-upright-shark-nv360-navigator-lift-away-deluxe-upright-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall, Upright</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe Upright Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Prime Day Shark NV360 Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe Upright Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Zi8yzutdE7kb7pPP2caZjB6hv9U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Shark-Navigator-Lift-Away-Deluxe-Upright-Vacuum-6371dc3ce0194d5aa4177b15b52e0267.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Noise Level</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>We found this vacuum to be straightforward to put together and use.<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>It performed well on both hardwood and carpeted floors.<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>It includes a HEPA filter to catch any stray particles while you vacuum.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>This model felt a little bulky to push around.<br></p></li><li readability=0><p>It's corded, which can be inconvenient.<br></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After days of testing, this vacuum was a clear standout, picking up top scores in nearly every category. Shark has made a product that's easy to use and powerful enough to effortlessly suck up stubborn particles like pet hair and cereal in one pass.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found that the Shark Navigator was incredibly straightforward to put together out of the box, with everything sliding together in just three minutes. No matter what surface we ran the vacuum over — including hardwood floors and low-, medium-, and high-pile carpets — it was a breeze to maneuver, effortlessly gliding across even the thickest of rugs. The vacuum has multiple settings for carpets and hardwood floors, which makes it seamless to switch between the two surfaces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At 15 pounds, the Shark upright vacuum cleaner is fairly lightweight; it can even be used with just one hand. Plus, it has a HEPA filter, which, as Dr. Joshi pointed out, is incredibly important.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, this one is not cordless — but that may not be a drawback to you if you prefer a traditional upright vacuum. We also noted that it is a little bulky, which prevented us from fully reaching under big pieces of furniture like couches and coffee tables. But overall, shoppers who are searching for a vacuum cleaner that's user-friendly and powerful will be impressed by the Shark Navigator.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After two months of continued testing in a home with not one, but two Australian Shepherds, this model maintained its spot as the best upright vacuum overall. The tester vacuumed with it once a week to lift pet hair, dirt, grass, and other debris that found its way into their home. It navigated tile, hardwoods, and rugs with ease and proved easy to maneuver around furniture and corners. The crevice tool attachment was also a huge help when it came to cleaning furniture cushions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Bagless, corded, upright | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 45.66 x 9.64 x 12 inches |<strong> Weight: </strong>16 pounds | <strong>Filter Type:</strong> HEPA | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 9 quarts | <strong>Cord Length:</strong> 25 feet | <strong>Included Accessories:</strong> Crevice tool, dusting brush, turbo brush</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-cordless-shark-vertex-duoclean-powerfins-cordless-stick-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall, Cordless</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shark Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shark Vertex DuoClean PowerFins Cordless Stick Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/wJQKkmf5wzeaD4wxgxZZZOElsw8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shark-vertex-duoclean-powerfins-cordless-stick-vacuum-9e8ab794317e4cc7bcabbf976382c5ea.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>It performs well on all surfaces, making it a great option for those who vacuum daily.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This is lightweight and can be assembled in under five minutes.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has an extremely powerful suction for a stick vacuum.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're searching for a vacuum cleaner that won't bog you down with long, tangled cords, we recommend the Shark IZ462H Vertex DuoClean PowerFins Lightweight Cordless Stick Vacuum. We found that its comprehensive functions are so hands-off that it basically vacuums for you. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cordless stick vacuums</a> are incredibly convenient and easy to use, and this particular one is just as powerful as an upright.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unboxing this vacuum is a bit tedious, but despite multiple parts being wrapped in plastic, the Shark cordless vacuum cleaner is still able to come together in under five minutes. On hardwood floors, the vacuum sucks everything up instantly — no kernels or pieces of cereal flying around — and it effectively picked up debris on three types of carpets on the first go. We also appreciated how little effort it takes to use and move the machine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since the vacuum is so narrow and slim, it's easy to bend and maneuver under the couch and coffee table. It also has LED headlights, illuminating all the dust and hair you may have otherwise missed. And it's quiet for a powerful device, although it does become louder when it rolls over bigger pieces of debris. Users can operate the vacuum cleaner for up to 60 minutes at a time before it needs to be recharged.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, this vacuum doesn't have a big canister, so we had to empty it much more often than competing devices. The vacuum also does not have any place to house its attachments on its slim body, so you'll need to store them elsewhere. Plus, for the budget-minded, the vacuum is still on the expensive side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Those who are searching for a cordless vacuum that's effective on several types of surfaces, converts into a handheld device, and is refreshingly quiet should opt for this Shark model.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Bagless, cordless | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 27.6 x 11.8 x 9.4 inches |<strong> Weight: </strong>12.52 pounds | <strong>Filter Type:</strong> HEPA | <strong>Capacity:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Cord Length:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Included Accessories:</strong> Crevice and nozzle tool</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-5 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3840 data-sizes=750px alt="Shark Vertex Lightweight Cordless Stick Vacuum with DuoClean PowerFins" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/sDD95TCaFZ_VpCycpr0T8sSAegw=/fit-in/1500x3840/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shark-vertex-duoclean-powerfins-lightweight-cordless-stick-vacuum-phoebe-cheong-photo-03-0fd2a301a9f44627a4afd19c22f9920a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>The Spruce / Phoebe Cheong</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3783 data-sizes=750px alt="Person using Shark Vertex IZ462H Ultra Lightweight Cordless Stick Vacuum under a wood table on carpet" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/jZ_1M4rzh2At2Ss2qd8f9WhbIUU=/fit-in/1500x3783/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shark-vertex-duoclean-powerfins-lightweight-cordless-stick-vacuum-phoebe-cheong-photo-02-bf4175a2aede45b0bb706be1d9e70596.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Phoebe Cheong</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-canister-miele-compact-c1-turbo-team-bagged-canister-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall, Canister</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Miele C1 Turbo Team Canister Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Miele Compact C1 Turbo Team Bagged Canister Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/_bsFi3rFeoN3A2Qo7WOdjkKZFy0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Miele-Compact-C1-Turbo-Team-Bagged-Canister-Vacuum-9458d66b706146efa02bf326d4683d4b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Noise Level</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>It performs well on hardwood floors and low-pile carpets.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It is easy to maneuver under couches and coffee tables.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This vacuum only took a few passes to suction up all the popcorn and pet hair.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Users often gravitate toward <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>canister vacuums</a> if their homes are mostly hard floors and low-pile carpets — which is what the Miele Compact C1 Turbo Team Bagged Canister Vacuum is best on. This vacuum gobbled up hair on hardwood floors and picked up everything in one go over low-pile carpets. Even on thicker carpets, it only needed a few passes to successfully suction popcorn and hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to the slim hose design, the vacuum is able to maneuver under couches and coffee tables and effortlessly reach into tight corners. This vacuum is also among the quietest of the devices we tried, which is always a plus in our book. And although the vacuum isn't cordless, it does have an auto-rewind feature that pulls in the cord in a snap.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This vacuum cleaner has a bagged canister, allowing you to use it until it's full before tossing it. Plus, it has a three-tiered filtration system — an excellent feature for those concerned about dust and dander. But be warned that even though the vacuum is pretty small, the canister is heavier than expected.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your home is mostly hardwood floors and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>washable rugs</a> and you're looking for a device that may help with allergies, choose the Miele Compact C1 Turbo Team Bagged Canister Vacuum.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Bagged canister | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 16.19 x 9.1 x 9.8 |<strong> Weight: </strong>15 pounds | <strong>Filter Type:</strong> AirClean FilterBag | <strong>Capacity:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Cord Length:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Included Accessories:</strong> Turbo brush floorhead, dusting brush, crevice tool, upholstery tool</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-robot-irobot-roomba-694-robot-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall, Robot</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>iRobot Roomba 694 Robot Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon iRobot Roomba 694 Robot Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/rdm7-QpvX6-uIeA47Mz0hCwTt68=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/irobot-roomba-694-robot-vacuum-2bfb47a8ef2c488dbcefefa68da00339.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Noise Level</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>It works well on both hard flooring and carpets.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It navigates well around furniture.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This technology in the vacuum allows it to effectively vacuum unsupervised.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If this list of vacuums has already made you exhausted from just thinking about the task of vacuuming your house, then the iRobot Roomba 694 Robot Vacuum may be the one for you. The iRobot was the crowned winner in our robot vacuum test, thanks to its effectiveness on all types of flooring, from hardwood and tile to carpeting. It took us less than five minutes to get this robot vacuum going after removing it from the box. This short time period includes downloading the app and setting up the vacuum's cleaning schedule on our phones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As robots can only do so much that humans cannot, the Roomba had some issues detecting the edges of rugs and carpeting, staying away from those areas as if it sensed a drop-off or staircase. With this in mind, you may have to nudge it along when it gets to the edge of a surface, but it is fantastic at maneuvering around obstacles like chair legs and couches. This robot vacuum doesn't have mapping technology, but for an appliance that can effectively clean for you while you go about your day, we'd say this model is as good as it gets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester used the iRobot vacuum weekly for six months and continued to be delighted by how efficiently it sucked up dirt, debris, hair, and more. They disliked the chore of vacuuming so they appreciated the self-sufficient nature of the robot vacuum. They noted it was impressive and disgusting how much grime the vacuum got off their floors. Essentially, the vacuum continues to earn its best overall title.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Bagless, robot | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>13.4 x 13.4 x 3.54 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 6.8 pounds | <strong>Filter Type:</strong> High-efficiency | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 0.15 gallons | <strong>Cord Length: </strong>Not applicable | <strong>Included Accessories: </strong>Docking station, extra filter, Wi-Fi connectivity, phone app</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-dirt-devil-versa-3-in-1-cordless-stick-vacuum-cleaner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dirt Devil Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Dirt Devil Versa 3-in-1 Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/i2nM0b09ZmrLqHEhvP7SpYdcIJs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dirt-devil-versa-3-in-1-cordless-stick-vacuum-cleaner-4208be0ea23b46f980a01f9c4e6022ac.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Noise Level</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>This is the most inexpensive vacuum on our list, yet it still performs incredibly well.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It is easy to set up and maneuver around multiple floor types and furniture.</p></li><li readability=0><p>It has a spacious dust bin, so you can go longer before having to empty it.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Vacuums are one of those household items that usually require an upfront investment, which is why this under-$100 DirtDevil is something to write home about. The Versa Cordless 3-in-1 Stick Vac is a powerful machine, gliding around any type of flooring effortlessly. Its lightweight frame and cordless design help you get into every corner without having to switch a cord to a closer socket.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This DirtDevil vacuum was extremely easy to set up, as the body of the vacuum came pre-assembled, and we just had to tack on the handle and wand. Since it's a fairly simple machine, the Versa doesn't come with any additional attachments — but we think that's okay for the effective cleaning that you get from just the vacuum itself. As we maneuvered it around an obstacle course of furniture and a variety of floor types, we were impressed with how lightweight and powerful it was as it glided around chair legs with ease (we especially loved its cordlessness during this task).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our only note was the noise level because this vacuum was pretty loud while in use. It would be difficult to carry on a conversation while vacuuming, but who's really doing that, anyway? For all of our tests, whether it be coffee grounds on carpet or hair strewn on tile, the DirtDevil rose up to the challenge (and did so at a fabulous price). We'd recommend it to anyone looking to be a little conscious of their spending when adding a new cleaning device to their home or those hoping for a quality starter vacuum.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Bagless, cordless | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 2.5 x 10 x 7.8 inches |<strong> Weight: </strong>5 pounds | <strong>Filter Type:</strong> Washable | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 0.10 gallons | <strong>Cord Length:</strong> Not applicable | <strong>Included Accessories:</strong> None</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-dyson-v12-detect-slim-absolute></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dyson V12 Detect Slim Absolute</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dyson V12 Detect Slim Absolute" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/4SCHsN_7n2Dr60x2tTLvT5wxqow=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dyson_v12_detect_slim_absolute-b5a4fc853a394d8f9f871211889c661f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dyson</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Noise Level</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>It is easy to navigate darker spaces with a built-in laser light on the brush head.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This vacuum features a single-touch power button.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It is incredibly lightweight.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Loyal Dyson fans will be happy to know that the new V12 Detect Slim Cordless model is a solid pick with upgraded features — but it will set you back a few hundred dollars. (By a few hundred dollars, we mean around $650.) There are a few outstanding features that make this Dyson different from the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>other Dyson vacuums</a> on the market.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">First, there's a single-touch power button, so you don't have to hold down a trigger button the entire time you vacuum. Second, at just over 5 pounds, it's super lightweight, making it easy to maneuver from one room to another during its extended 60-minute battery run time. And perhaps most importantly, it comes with a laser light on the brush head that illuminates dirt, dust, pet hair, and more, so that you can efficiently clean your space.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are plenty of other features we could highlight, but we need to talk about the cons. While the dust bin was incredibly easy to empty, there was some hair stuck inside that had to be manually fetched out at the end of its cleaning run. And while it showed superior performance on our testing carpet, it didn't do as well on the bare floor. It took about 25 passes to pick up all of the popcorn kernels and Cheerios from the lab's hard flooring. However, if you are a Dyson collector and already own the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Omni-Glide model</a> for your bare floors, then this is an outstanding upgraded option for your carpets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our long-term tester was pleased with the vacuum's performance over the six months they tested it at home. They use the vacuum weekly and haven't noticed any changes in the quality, apart from occasional discrepancies with the run time monitor. That said, the vacuum cleans our tester's whole apartment without needing a charge. The suction continues to be effective and our tester hasn't needed to pull any hair from the rollers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Bagless, cordless | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.8 x 9.9 x 49.1 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 5.2 pounds | <strong>Filter Type:</strong> Whole machine filtration | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 0.1 gallons | <strong>Cord Length:</strong> Not applicable | <strong>Included Accessories: </strong>Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head, Motorbar cleaner head, crevice tool, hair screw tool, combination tool</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-smart-tineco-pure-one-s15-pro-cordless-stick-vacuum-cleaner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Smart</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tineco Pure One S15 Pro</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tineco Pure One S15 Pro Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/XNUHPTfGeTafDkQAOxsj-s44beM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tineco-pure-one-s15-pro-smart-cordless-stick-vacuum-cleaner-9dbd147c6cfb480d9e3db3763ce6d44c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tineco</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Noise Level</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>It features an LED light that illuminates debris.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It includes a standing dock for easy storage.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The digital screen keeps track of your floor's cleanliness.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>This is the most expensive model on our list, but the features make it worth a heftier price tag.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The motor head is a bit heavy.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Tineco vacuum cleaner is an amazing option for those looking to geek out on smart features or anyone who needs extra help supercharging their clean. The Tineco digital screen turns red when encountering dirt and blue when the area has been sufficiently cleaned, but this model also automatically goes into a short max power mode when it comes into contact with a big mess — so it's really putting in the extra elbow grease for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It comes with a standing dock, so you don't have to mount anything to a wall (which is great for renters) and it not only includes helpful attachments, but it also includes a place to store them, so you won't lose them within the first week of owning your vacuum. The LED light on the brush head helps to illuminate any pet hair, crumbs, or other debris that might be lurking in your corners or along your baseboards. However, these features come with a high price tag and our at-home tester noted that the motor portion of the vacuum gets to be a bit heavy after using it for an extended period of time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We continued testing this vacuum for six months to see how it held up in a real-world setting. Our tester appreciated the consistency of the battery life and the convenience of the docking station —&nbsp;which charges the vacuum and holds all the accessories. It's a great vacuum for hardwood floors and quick cleanups. Plus, you can make changes manually or use the auto-pilot functions, and the vacuum will adjust its action based on the level of dirt present.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Bagless, cordless | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11 x 11.4 x 45 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>6.8 pounds | <strong>Filter Type:</strong> Magnetic filter and 5-stage filtration | <strong>Capacity: </strong>Not listed | <strong>Cord Length:</strong> Not applicable | <strong>Included Accessories:</strong> Mini power brush, 2-in-1 dust brush, crevice tool, stand</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-quiet-kenmore-elite-csv-max-216v-cordless-stick-vacuum-with-easyreach-wand></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Quiet</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kenmore Elite Cordless Stick Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Kenmore DS4095 Elite Cordless Stick Vacuum with EasyReach Wand" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/5jlFWT5d_Knff4pzqWh-OxIHHB8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kenmore-ds4095-elite-cordless-stick-vacuum-with-easyreach-wand-f69ba2415b2d44e3949a1375f928946b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Noise Level</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>It is super lightweight at just 3 pounds.</p></li><li readability=0><p>It is extremely quiet, clocking in at only 65 decibels.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This vacuum is easy to maneuver around any obstacle.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>We found this model a bit difficult to empty.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Despite our efforts, hair was still stuck in the dustbin from our first testing day.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We'd go as far as to say that the Kenmore Elite Cordless Stick Vacuum was the quietest vacuum we've ever used. Clocking in at only 65 decibels, it was incredibly easy to carry on a conversation while the vacuum sucked up everything in its path. On top of its quiet operation, this cordless vacuum only weighs three pounds. Three pounds! But still, we were impressed with how easily it maneuvered around corners, furniture, and any obstacle that stood in the way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even though it was an effective, quiet, and easy-to-use vacuum, the size and shape of the dustbin made it difficult to empty. We also had to manually fetch some of the hair out of the dustbin, and unfortunately, we weren't able to retrieve all of it. But if you don't live in a household that's constantly shedding, that might not be a dealbreaker for you, so we're still including this quiet vacuum on our list for those who like to clean while babies are sleeping or while they simultaneously conduct FaceTime calls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it's held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At the six-month mark of testing, our team was still really pleased with the performance of this vacuum.

The Shark Wandvac Cordless Stick Vacuum does just that, emptying itself into a HEPA filter bag every time it's attached to the charging base.

Sign us up. The hands-free Shark 2-in-1 Vacuum and Mop Robot with Matrix Clean Navigation is a tried and true favorite in the household, especially if you want your space to get clean before you get home (yes, you can program it to clean while you're at work so you come back to sparkling floors).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This vacuum connects to an app that allows you to map out the areas of your home and the number of rooms that you want it to clean in a sitting. With area mapping, you can program the machine to avoid furniture, move to different rooms, and even set parameters of a room for deep cleaning, should it need it. Another perk is that it practically moves silently, operating far quieter than most vacuums on our list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Shark is a great option for those who have children or pets leaving piles of destruction behind them, but the robot did have a bit of trouble getting into corners due to its circular shape. You also have to be a bit tech-savvy to understand how to set up this machine, as it's a little tough to figure out solely from the included instructions. However, we think that the price is very reflective of the value that you are getting from this 2-in-1 vacuum and mop duo because of its exceptional clean and zero-effort functionality.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Bagless, robot | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 21.4 x 14.96 x 5.7 inches |<strong> Weight: </strong>23.57 pounds | <strong>Filter Type:</strong> HEPA | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 0.06 gallons | <strong>Cord Length:</strong> Not applicable | <strong>Included Accessories:</strong> Side brushes, mopping pads, cleaning solution, phone app</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-hardwood-floors-dyson-omni-glide-cordless-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Hardwood Floors</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dyson Omni-Glide</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dyson Omni-Glide+ Cordless Vacuum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/BtlljFJ2AsQ5C-nN3BJoZ9PAbdA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dyson-omni-glide---vacuum-41c2c92bbf3c47bc890c3f533f2cf606.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dyson</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Emptying</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>It's quieter than most models we tested.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Due to its light weight, it was super easy to maneuver.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The small swivel head makes it easy to get in corners and under couches.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to home devices, whether for cleaning or beauty, there's no one doing it quite like Dyson. The Omni-Glide + was a standout for us when testing vacuums for hardwood floors, due to its sleek design, lightweight feel, and easy mobility.

In under one minute, each mess of hair, popcorn, and other pieces of debris were effectively sucked up into the machine's canister. Not to mention that its noise level was considerably lower than others we've tried, making this a huge plus in our book.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We think this is the perfect vacuum for small spots and quick cleanups because of its agile design. (You can fold it flat to fit under low furniture!) However, its slender canister can only hold about 0.2 liters of debris. This means you'll have to empty it more frequently if you're vacuuming a large area, but its quick cleans and maneuverability make the trash visits well worth it. You also get a cleaner head, mini motorized tool, combination crevice tool, light pipe crevice tool, docking station, and charger in the mix — just without built-in storage (but hey, that's what storage closets are for).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dyson remains supreme for all of your home (and hair) styling needs, especially when it comes to the Omni-Glide+.

So while bagged vacuum cleaners tend to offer less allergen exposure during the emptying process, it's important to properly maintain your vacuum and use a mask and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rubber gloves</a> when emptying the dust bin or changing a very full vacuum bag.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.89811320754717><p><span class=accordion__title>Are there better vacuum cleaners than Dyson vacuums?</span></p><p>In our testing, we found other brands that performed basic functions as well or better than the Dyson vacuum cleaners we tested (though the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dyson V12 Detect Slim Cordless Stick Vacuum</a> as well as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Omni-Glide+</a> have been mainstays). Dyson is known for its innovative features and whole filtration system, but if those things are not important to you, there are plenty of other brands such as Shark, Samsung, Tineco, Miele, and more that offer extremely high-performing vacuums.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How long should a vacuum last?</span></p><p>A quality vacuum should last around eight years, but some brands, such as Dyson, offer a 10-year limited warranty.
