According to Essence, they met at a Memphis comedy club in 1990, where Steve stood on stage and humorously told her, “I don’t know who you are, but I’m going to marry you.”</p><p>The couple dated briefly before splitting. Marjorie, in a 2010's&nbsp;interview with Essence, also revealed that they were friends’ years ago and dated for some time.</p><p>She also admitted that none of them broke their heart; it was just the long-distance relationship that made them go their separate ways. Steve further stated to&nbsp;People that his bodyguard was the one who told him to date, Marjorie.</p><p></p><p><strong>Husband-Wife: </strong>Marjorie with her husband, Steve Harvey (Photo: Marjorie Harvey’s Instagram)</p><p>The power couple Marjorie and Steve share seven kids together.

Marjorie, in an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a> in 2016, spoke about her blended family. She said; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“We knew this was right. But I just told them, ‘Everyone is included. Everyone has access to their parents. Whatever you didn’t have before, don’t let that interfere with what you can have now.’ ”</p><p>Even though they do not have children of their own, they are leading a happy family life together.</p><p>Recently, on February 2018 on the Valentine’s Day, Marjorie <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wished </a>her husband Steve a Happy Valentine’s day, saying that he makes her heart sing every day.</p><h2>Marjorie and her Spouse’s Past Relationships</h2><p>Marjorie, like her current husband Steve, was married twice in her life. As per the sources, she was married to two notorious drug dealers. Her first husband was the drug lord, Jim L. Townsend, who was sentenced to life in prison and served 26 years before President Barack Obama gave him an eleventh-hour pardon in January 2017. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She shared her first two children Jason and Morgan with Jim.</p><p>Marjorie split with Jim less than five years after his sentence, and<span> </span>Having divorced him, it seemed as if she wanted to run away from the antisocial life but her addiction to it couldn't let her&nbsp;run away all that soon.</p><p>For the second time, she got married to another drug seller Donell Woods, similar to her ex-husband. As expected, Donell was soon caught by Police due to his anti-social activity which resulted in a divorce&nbsp;in 2001. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She had her third child, daughter Lori with her second husband. She got and as of now, has no relationship with her ex-husbands.</p><p>Similarly, on the other side of the moon, her husband Steve was also married twice before marrying Marjorie. He was wedded to his first wife, Marcia Harvey, from 1980 to 1994. He shares three children with Marcia, twin daughters Karli and Brandi and son Broderick.</p><p>After divorce with Marcia, he got married to his second wife, Mary Shackelford, in 1996. It was exactly when Stevie came to know about Marjorie Harvey and was often seen following spending time with her.</p><p>It was obvious that relationship insecurities issues would rise among him and his wife Shackelford and it happened too which&nbsp;resulted in a divorce&nbsp;in 2005.</p><h3><strong>Sneak-Peak On Her Professional Career</strong></h3><p>Even though Marjorie is the wife of a man whose net worth is around $140 million and annual salary about $40 million, she is not the one to sit back home and let his man do all the job.&nbsp;She is a businesswoman on her own and runs her own fashion blog.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-4 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>With her husband support and encouragement, in 2014, she turned her passion into a fashion and lifestyle blog, ‘The Lady Loves Couture’ which explores her exciting fashion excursions while also providing exclusive insight and tips for living lavishly on any budget.</p><p>She also&nbsp;runs the Steve and Marjorie Harvey Foundation (SMHF) which officially inaugurated in 2010 for reaching out the unreached.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Kus7bOq6CeZZKntqWzxKxksKefmcBursioZJqflWK1tr%2FBmqWdZZuesbR5z5qpnqakqHqvsdNmrqiqpJ16p63MoqOyZZWteqnB0puYp5xencGuuA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mazhar-khan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mazhar Khan (actor)">&larr;
