The show, which ran for six seasons and concluded in September 2017, was an instant cult classic, leaving viewers wanting more from their favorite wolfpack.</p><p>In September 2021, Paramount Plus revealed that a reunion film, <a href=#>directed by <strong>Russell Mulcahy</strong> and written by series creator <strong>Jeff Davis</strong></a>, was in the works. The supernatural thriller, which debuted on January 26, 2023, features Scott and his pack back in their hometown 15 years later to face an old nemesis — and protect Beacon Hills from a familiar threat.</p><p>When news of the revival first broke, fans were instantly&nbsp;curious which characters would show up in the project — especially <strong>Arden Cho’s</strong> Kira (who mysteriously disappeared during season 5) and fan-favorite Stiles Stilinski, played by <a href=#><strong>Dylan O’Brien</strong></a>.</p><p>In February 2022, Deadline reported that&nbsp;Cho declined to return for the Teen Wolf revival after she was offered half the per-episode salary of her three fellow actresses:&nbsp;<strong>Shelley Hennig</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Holland Roden</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Crystal Reed</strong></a>. (Reed, for her part, was returning as Allison Argent after exiting the show in season 3.)</p><p>“I think I was actually offered even less,” Cho said when asked about her salary during an interview with <a href=#>The Cut </a>at the time. “I probably would’ve never shared it.&nbsp;&nbsp;… I could probably, off the top of my head, think of over 10&nbsp;Asian American actors I know who were paid significantly less than their counterparts. Sometimes you don’t have a choice to say ‘no.’ Sometimes you just need it. <a href=#>You’ve got bills to pay</a>. I wasn’t saying ‘no’ necessarily for me or because I was angry. I was saying ‘no’ because I hope that there will be more equality in the future.”</p><p>While Cho initially became a series regular on the supernatural series in season 4,&nbsp;she was abruptly cut from the story, telling The Cut that “there wasn’t room for Kira.”</p><p>After the film premiered, however, eagle-eyed fans quickly realized that the Partner Track alum’s place had been filled by another character, Hikari, played by<strong> Amy L. Workman</strong>. Though the character of Hikari is also Asian American, Kitsune and kind like Kira, there is no explanation of&nbsp;who she is or how she became a part of Scott’s pack. The character simply appears, leaving audiences to wonder if she is a stand-in for what should have been Cho.</p><p>Following Cho’s statement on her decision not to return, O’Brien took to social media to show his support for his former costar by “liking” a fan comment via Twitter in February 2022. “Arden said, ’nah,’” the tweet read, alongside an excerpt from her interview with The Cut.</p><p>One month later,&nbsp;the Not Okay star revealed that <a href=#>he made the “difficult” decision not to reprise his role</a> as Stiles.</p><p>“A lot went into it,” the Love and Monsters star explained to <a href=#>Variety</a> in March 2022. “The show couldn’t be more dear to me. It was the first thing I ever did I and so many people there are extremely dear to me. It was something I was trying to make work but it all happened very fast. We didn’t really know that it was happening and they kind of just threw it at us a little bit, which is fine because we all love the show. We were trying to figure it out.”</p><p>O’Brien explained that he ultimately<a href=#> felt like his character was “left in a really good place”</a> and he wanted to “still leave it there,” but “wished them well” and would be watching “the first night [the movie] comes out.”</p><p>“I hope it f—king kicks ass, but I’m not going to be in it,” he quipped.</p><p>Davis, for his part, told <a href=#>Collider</a> in August 2022 that the movie would “reference” the First Time star’s absence.&nbsp;“I think we can’t do the movie without paying tribute to the character Stiles. So he comes up in more than one situation,” he shared.</p><p>The Wolf Pack creator also noted that Stiles’&nbsp;love interest, Lydia (Roden), <a href=#>would be given a “big storyline” about their relationship</a> that fans could “look&nbsp;forward” to watching unfold.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>However, when Lydia returns to Beacon Hills in the film, she reveals that&nbsp;she and Stiles have called it quits when a dream about a fatal car accident left her worried for his safety. After <a href=#>breaking up with him in order to hopefully save his life</a>, she finds herself heartbroken and unable to access her supernatural powers. While she eventually finds her voice, the twosome’s split leaves questions in its wake:&nbsp;Was it a dream or a premonition? Is Stiles still destined to die either way? Will they ever reconcile?</p><p>Scroll down to find out what questions were answered — and what we still need answers to — following the Teen Wolf movie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bpsqa6jLCmpZ5dqbWmecyoraKdo2K6sL%2FTZpmuqp6eu6h50K6crKyZpLu0edKtsJ2hkWK4qr7AZqSoqpVif3A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./trevor-tordjman-19951122-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Trevor Tordjman (Dancer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
