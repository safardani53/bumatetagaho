Ray continues to quietly dominate.</p><p>"It's interesting how different champs can have very different styles--Cris Pannullo, for example, has an intense energy, while Ray feels much more laid-back--but either way, they win consistently and convincingly."</p><p>Another wrote: "I think part of what's made Ray's games so exciting is that they haven't all been runaways. He has had some really good competition!"</p><p>​​And a third: "Ray is so lovely and I’m so happy to have another wonderful Canadian champion."</p><p>A fourth agreed: "What great games all week. Exciting and with the great outcome of Ray continuing!"</p><p>"LONG MAY HE RAYN" wrote a fifth.</p><h2>RAY SWAYS FANS HIS WAY</h2><p>Ray has revealed he has a <a href=#>twin brother</a> and his sibling is "in the process of auditioning for Jeopardy! right now."</p><p>He also shared he's a father-of-one, says "please" when asking for clues, and many viewers love his <a href=#>"sexy narrator voice."</a></p><p>He's also correct on 90 percent of clues and batting 10/0 on Daily Doubles per <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeopardy!</a> - so he may not be seeking them out, but he's correct when he gets them.</p><p>Some tough customers have taken to various online forums to complain that as the contestant responds to clues and keeps winning, he's also constantly swaying back and forth.</p><p>On the show's podcast Inside Jeopardy on Monday,&nbsp;<a href=#>longtime producer Sarah Foss</a>&nbsp;acknowledged the show is aware of his swaying too: "Ray, He kind of likes to move back and forth during his gameplay."</p><p>"Which is difficult for our camera operators."</p><p>"So he may or may not have gotten the nickname 'Ray the Sway.'"</p><p>"But Ray, however it is you like to win Jeopardy!, you do you!"</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TBS News Watch</a>, the reasoning behind&nbsp;<a href=#>Ray's swaying</a>&nbsp;is more than justified, it's due to a medical ailment.</p><p>The outlet wrote: "He suffered some spinal cord&nbsp;damage over a period of years, and had to work hard to prevent muscle spasms in his legs while he was on camera."</p><p>One viewer wrote on Twitter as the wins keep coming: "I will defend Jeopardy Ray like he is my grandpa. Y’all leave that cute little man alone. Sway and slay all day, Ray!!"</p><h2>'KARAOKE NIGHT?'</h2><p>Ray recently told Jeopardy! he's <a href=#>a fan of another recent contestant</a> - and Canadian - <a href=#>Mattea Roach.</a></p><p>“I’ve got a ways to catch up to her,” Ray said about Mattea, win-wise, between two episodes. “But it’d be lovely to meet her sometime and share stories.”</p><p>"Maybe Weird Al [Yankovic] could go to Toronto sometime and we could all sing [his parody song] 'I Lost on Jeopardy!."</p><p>Mattea doesn't seem opposed as earlier this week they gave their stamp of approval on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>.</p><p>"Canadian back at the champ’s podium today, I know that’s right!!" they wrote, adding they're watching all his episodes.</p><p>"Perfect timing too bc I just got home for the holidays so I actually have access to cable TV to watch Ray defend his title."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Mattea was not only the first Gen-Z super-champ (winning at least 10 games) but the&nbsp;<a href=#>first Canadian</a>&nbsp;to win big when they competed in Season 38.</p><p>Ray will return on Monday as his winning streak and all its welcome quirks are becoming something of a Christmas miracle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/champ-ray-lalonde-wins-7th-784698793.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/fans-stunned-champ-mattea-roach-731111527-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/champ-cris-pannullo-loses-21-781140195-11.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huaW1%2FdH2SaKGep6CWv6XFjKuYsmWclrmwusOeZLChnqOys3nKnqVmopWju6q6xqxkrKyimq6sew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kim-kardashian-celebrates-easter-with-black-jesus-kimoji.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Kardashian Celebrates Easter with Black Jesus Kimoji">&larr;
