The original TikTokroom subsequently reposted Orlove’s Instagram live-streamed rage over the matter. In the tape, the TikToker claims that LaVerne gave out his address and phone information. He claimed that Emma Throne, a fan of LaVerne, had harassed him and his family for months. A few hours after the video went online, Orlove elaborated on the abuse in the comments area.</p><p>He said that Thorne had not only dispatched police to his residence, but also to the residence of his girlfriend, Tess Krauser. He stated that this had been occurring for months, and he had no intention of going public until his mother informed him that a girl named Indiana had been emailing them with very harsh language all day.</p><h2>Citizens Suspect Cody Orlove of Lying Regarding Harassment</h2><p>Unfortunately for Orlove, relatively few commenters seemed to support his position. Instead, they accused the TikToker of lying and exploiting the name of his ex-girlfriend for influence. “I feel like I don’t believe him. When he mentions Zoe is the only time he is relevant. A user said, “She doesn’t have time for this since she has a spouse and a child.”</p><p>“When he need relevance, he employs Zoey. She has a child and a spouse, so move on. And did she not accuse you of harassment?” said another user. A third person questioned his claims, saying, “How does Zoey know your address, and why has your phone number been the same from the beginning?”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Zoe-LaVerne-1.jpg alt="Zoe LaVerne" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Cody Orlove and Zoe LaVerne’s Contentious Background</h2><p>However, several individuals believed Orlove was speaking the truth and brought up the history between Orlove and LaVerne. The former couple dated from 2017 to 2020, despite their relationship being marked by conflict. They exploited their friendship with combined YouTube channels, concerts, and goods promotion. Additionally, they issued a single. They announced their “amicable” breakup in June 2020, but behind the scenes, it was a different story.</p><p>LaVerne told her supporters privately that Orlove had mistreated her, but when the story went public, she recanted and apologized for her false statements.&nbsp;However, days after LaVerne’s apology, an audio recording surfaced that sounded as though Orlove was physically detaining LaVerne against her will as she shouted at him to “let go.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Zoe-LaVerne-2.jpg alt="Zoe LaVerne" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>LaVerne later stated on Instagram live that she had been mistreated. Orlove apologized for harming his ex-girlfriend but said that he had no intention of abusing or harassing her. Instead, he reasoned that they were in a poisonous relationship as adolescents and sometimes went too far.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGixqJ1doa63sdGnnGaho2KupK%2FUrJydZZ%2Bbeqmt0ZqqrKWVo8Furthmn6KrXZrFbq7Osp2roZWjsW6vzp2wZqeioby3sY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chitty-chitty-bang-bang-actress-sally-ann-howes-dead.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' Actress Sally Ann Howes Dead at 91">&larr;
