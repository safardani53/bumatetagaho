Nobody has the right to put tips in their pocket whatsoever. I have over 50 CCTV cameras in the building that are visual and voice activated.</p><p>“I can hear everything and I can see everything. If I see again, yes again, that someone has put money in their pocket from a customer I will either 1.) report it to the police or 2.) take them into the basement.</p><p>“Simple as that. You take money from me, I’ll take something from you.”</p><p>Since the recording was shared online, the restaurant has been flooded with negative reviews by shocked customers.&nbsp;</p><p>A local solicitor said: “A lot of my clients eat there because it’s the newest place to be.</p><p>“People were a bit concerned about this basement at the bottom of the property and are scared about who is operating the restaurant.</p><p>“Everyone’s too frightened to say anything.”</p><p>The recording has been shared hundreds of times online, with one diner commenting: “This is mad I went there and had a lovely waitress. I gave her a good tip I’m mad to think the management got it after she did all that hard work.”</p><p>Another restaurant owner added: “That’s horrible to say the least. I have a restaurant and every tip goes to the team. This owner clearly is sitting on his brains.”</p><h2>'I'M NOT GOING TO CHOP THEIR FINGERS OFF'</h2><p>Mr Melin told The Sun Online he had sent the voice message after two of his workers were caught stealing around £20 each in tips from his restaurant.</p><p>He declined to apologise for what he said in the memo, adding that over £400 worth of tips had been wrongly pocketed in the last two and a half weeks.</p><p>He said: "They were stealing their colleague's tips - not my money. That’s why I got irate. It’s really unfair, it’s not right.</p><p>"They were putting them straight in their pocket which is not how they are meant to do it. It's meant to go into a tips box that is locked.</p><p>"The general manger and the deputy manager opens the tips box monthly, divvies it all up and gives it out to the staff as a form of wage."</p><p>When asked what he meant by "the basement," Mr Melin explained: "We at Melin refer to the basement as the office area - the manager has an office down there.</p><p>"I’ve not told anybody I’m going to chop their fingers off or anything like that! You can go to the police or you can go down for a disciplinary - maybe I should have called it a disciplinary."</p><p>Mr Melin said the restaurant's tips policy is explained to all employees in their contract.</p><p>Addressing the concerns on their Instagram page, Melin Chigwell said they divide tips equally among employees and were “disappointed to learn staff were stealing tips” from the team.</p><p>They wrote: “We take pride in Melin’s wage structure, which sees each individual incentivised weekly* via tips collected that are then split among staff, so to learn staff were stealing tips from the entire team was extremely disappointing.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>“Even as a new business in a testing industry, we are committed as a group to keeping our staff in employment as well as incentivised.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“Just like any other restaurant, we continue to do all we can despite the hospitality trade taking a massive hit with the COVID-19.”</p><p>*Mr Melin confirmed to The Sun Online that tips are divvied up monthly not weekly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000611166068.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000611179107.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Melin-Chigwell-post.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000611166450.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/8dec917e-e83e-4cb6-bcbe-5e4c72b125b4.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn94hJdsZ25nn6y7pr6MnJylnZKntrXFjKGmraugpMFuvsSsq5qtopa7tXnPqKOim5ViwLWtxZ9kraGgqHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kate-bosworth-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Kate Bosworth's Net Worth?
