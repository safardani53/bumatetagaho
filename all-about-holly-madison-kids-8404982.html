Since her two children were born, Madison — who shares custody of her children with her ex-husband — has been “very, very protective” of their privacy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When my kids were babies, I used to post pictures of them on social media, but when they got old enough to be about in preschool and they're kind of out in the world, I started feeling like that wasn't the best choice and it wasn't the safest thing to do,” she told PEOPLE in November 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“And just everything I've been through being in the public eye and social media and seeing the things people write about me, I really want to be protective of my kids and give them the opportunity to choose when and if they're ever going to be public online," Madison continued.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about Holly Madison's 2 kids, Rainbow and Forest.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-rainbow></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Rainbow</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Holly Madison with Rainbow.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>holly madison/instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Madison and Rotella welcomed their first child, daughter Rainbow Aurora, on March 5, 2013. She <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>was born in a Las Vegas</a> hospital at 11:59 a.m., weighing in at 7 lbs., 2 oz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I wanted to give my daughter a unique name,” Madison&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>explained to E! News</a> shortly after the arrival of her firstborn. “Growing up, there was a girl in my school named Rainbow and I was so envious of that name. I thought it was so pretty and unique!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nine weeks after giving birth to Rainbow, the former Girls Next Door star told PEOPLE that she was “loving motherhood,” but was still adjusting to the unexpected challenges that come with raising babies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Things never work out the way you think they will... Right now the spit-ups have started," Madison said. Despite the common frustrations, though, Madison was all-in on growing her family as soon as possible: “I want to be that minivan mom," she said. "The one piled full of kids.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Rainbow was three years old, Madison <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shared updates</a> with PEOPLE about her little one's personality. “She’s very particular about things she likes,” she said of Madison. “And she gets frustrated easily — I do too!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though only a toddler at the time, Madison also told PEOPLE that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she'd be open and honest with Rainbow</a> about her own past, including when times were tough. “I would love for my daughter to learn from me... I want to share all my experiences, the ups and downs.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Madison, who moved into&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Playboy magnate Hugh Hefner’s mansion</a>&nbsp;when she was just 21 years old and spent the remainder of her twenties being forced to conform to a certain look Hefner preferred, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>previously told PEOPLE</a> that she was "the shy violet in the corner trying to be nice all the time" in her 20s.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Holly Madison's daughter Rainbow.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>holly madison/instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That can get you in a lot of trouble," she added. "I want Rainbow to learn to be verbal and stand up for herself. If I could go back, I’d be a lot more outspoken. I wouldn’t have allowed myself to be made to feel less than.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for whether she’d allow her daughter to ever pose for something like&nbsp;Playboy? "Never,” Madison said at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I want her to be confident and realize that there are ways to feel beautiful without exploiting yourself or putting yourself out there in a way you might regret.

Rotella was first to announce the news of their baby boy's arrival on Instagram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"What an incredible week. A crazy, stressful start, which transformed into this magical moment. First, a five-year-long indictment against me was&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>finally dismissed</a>; then yesterday Holly, Rainbow & I welcomed a healthy 8-pound, 14-ounce baby boy to the family," he wrote in part, sharing a photo of his newborn son's hand in his.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, when Forest was six weeks old, Madison — who also posted on her own <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>social media</a> when her baby boy was born — opened up to PEOPLE about the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>“stressful” three days</a> that came immediately after his birth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, Forest was swiftly taken to the NICU where he was hooked up to “a million machines." She recalled that medical staff “took him away to get the fluid out of his lungs. First it was the fluid, then it was jaundice, then his eyes weren’t dilating, and I spent hours thinking my baby couldn’t see.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But after doctors deemed Forest perfectly healthy, Madison and Rotella brought their baby home. In the almost two months that followed Forest’s birth, Madison said her “sweet” son was bonding well with the family, and his big sister Rainbow had “been great.” (Though, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pointed out</a> that "diaper changes are way harder with a boy.")</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the meaning behind Forest's moniker, Madison previously <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>explained to PEOPLE</a> that she and Rotella "liked the name because it’s just a very nature-themed name and it goes with Rainbow."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, “I came up with [his middle name, Leonardo,] because people would ask me when I was due and people would say, ‘Oh, he’s a Leo!’ So I kept thinking that was a sign.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like Rainbow, Madison prioritizes Forest's privacy. In fact, that preference was influenced by an interview the mom of two did shortly after welcoming her son.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Holly Madison attends the 13th annual Las Vegas Great Santa Run.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>David Becker/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They'd ask me about him and they'd be like, ‘Oh, so did you circumcise your son?’ I'm like, I'm not going to tell anybody that!” she told PEOPLE. “I don’t want somebody 15 years down the road who's in my son's school to be able to Google what his penis looks like! You know what I mean?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, if Madison does opt to post a photo of herself with either or both of her kids, she covers their faces with emojis.&nbsp;She herself remains public-facing, though, and tells PEOPLE her kids <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>keep her humble</a> regarding beauty standards.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I'm very relieved because my daughter and my son both roast me for dyeing my hair, they roast me for having extensions. They roast me when I wear a lot of makeup, so I think I'm good,” Madison said with a laugh.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Knock on wood, I think they're not going to fall into the trap of trying to make themselves look over-processed or trying too hard for the beauty standard because they are over it," she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5GhuW6twaisrWWYpLmtxYymmJ2ho6S7brfInapmcGRlgXqEkQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./buju-banton.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Buju Banton">&larr;
