The pair got engaged before ever seeing each other, but <a href=#>their relationship faltered</a> over conversations about finances. Stacy was wary about the fact that Izzy had a low credit score.</p><p class=p1>“She even <a href=#>had this jacket made</a> with my last name, like, she was excited, and then that finance conversation came up and she felt like I completely blindsided her,” he recalled on the podcast.</p><p class=p1>Izzy further claimed that Stacy had said, “Oh, my God, I feel like I can’t trust you,” before they got to the altar. According to Izzy, the twosome had the chat <a href=#>late in the filming process</a> because he was always busy with work and he didn’t think it was a “five-minute conversation to have.”</p><p class=p1>“We sat and talked it out and she was very uncomfortable with, like, [what I told her],” he told host <a href=#><strong>Nick Viall</strong></a>. “I [said] I didn’t have any debt, my student loans were paid off [and] I told her I was on a 1099 [tax form] because I switched over and I was doing insurance at the time, and she was like, ‘You’re on a 1099 instead of a W-2?’”</p><p class=p1>Izzy alleged that Stacy was nervous about “the lack of stability” of a 1099 — which consultants frequently use — since it doesn’t include benefits. “That kind of threw me for a loop,” he noted. “Like, damn, I didn’t realize. … [I said that] the only thing bad is that I have bad credit [because] I got [credit] cards when I was 18 [or] 19, f—ked it up and my credit was bad.”</p><p class=p1>Izzy, who has since improved his 580 credit score, further revealed that he “tried [his] absolute hardest” to make their relationship work, but <a href=#>he ultimately saw the writing on the wall</a> before being rejected at the altar.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Love-Is-Blind-Izzy-Zapata-Got-Financial-Advisor-1-Day-Before-Wedding-1.jpg><p class=p1>“She told me two days before [the wedding],” he told Nick, 43. “After the finance conversation, I thought, ‘This isn’t looking good.’ … [A couple days later], it’s great and we’re lying in bed and laughing and it led to the point of her saying, ‘Oh, I’m not gonna say yes.’ And I was just like, ‘What the f—k.’ She was just like, ‘I don’t feel like I can marry you right now, like, it’s too soon.’ And I was f—king destroyed.”</p><p class=p1>After calling off the wedding, the Netflix stars<a href=#> took a weeklong break without communicating</a> in order to process their emotions. They then made the decision to split for good and each found love again. Izzy even ran into Stacy and her new boyfriend on his first date with <a href=#>his new partner</a>, whom he has yet to go “official” with despite getting matching tattoos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalp6aaeqq%2FjJujoqaUqHqqxtmyZLOZoJbBonnGqKtmnpmjrq%2BvyJqjZpmUq7a0u9FmaGacka56o7HFqKmeZaeasaW1zaBm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./reasonable-doubt-is-set-to-be-released-on-hulu-channel-soon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Reasonable Doubt Is Set To Be Released On Hulu Channel Soon">&larr;
