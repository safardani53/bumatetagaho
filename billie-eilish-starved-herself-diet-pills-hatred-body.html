It's just crazy. I can't even believe, like I – wow. Yeah."</p><p>She then added of that pap photo: "I thought that I would be the only one dealing with my hatred for my body, but I guess the internet also hates my body. So that's great."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000481675324.jpg><p>Despite her relationship with her body, Billie stripped down to her bra to make a bold statement about body shaming during the first night of her Where Do We Go World Tour in&nbsp;<a href=#>Miami</a> back in March.</p><p>The superstar was seen&nbsp;<a href=#>taking off her top in a video that played in the background</a>&nbsp;as she discussed her battle to overcome everyone's "disapproval" over body image onstage.</p><p>In the two-minute clip, Billie slowly unzipped her top as her voiceover said: "I feel your stares, your disapproval."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000632553940.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000632553942.jpg><p>She then took her top off completely as she discussed the pressures of being a young female artist in an industry that sexualizes so many women.</p><p>Bille said: "If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman. If I shed the layers, I'm a s**t.</p><p>"Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it, and judge me for it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000561954414.jpg><p>Billie has not only spoken about her eating disorder, but she's also opened up about <a href=#>her plans to commit suicide back in 2018</a>.</p><p>During an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British GQ</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billie</a>&nbsp;opened up about her suicidal thoughts when asked about the online bullying she’s faced.</p><p>“Oh, God.

You good. And don’t kill yourself.’”</p><p>During the same interview, the Lovely songwriter also discussed her body image, and why she regularly dresses in her signature, oversized clothing.</p><p>Billie said: “I have never felt desired. My past boyfriends never made me feel desired. None of them.</p><p>“And it’s a big thing in my life that I feel I have never been physically desired by somebody.</p><p>“So I dress the way I dress as I don’t like to think of you guys – I mean anyone, everyone – judging it, or the size of it."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Billie first gained attention in 2015 when she and her brother uploaded Ocean Eyes to SoundCloud.</p><p>She soon gathered a cult following but skyrocketed to international fame after the release of her 2019 smash hit Bad Guy.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The March issue of Vanity Fair is available via digital download and on newsstands Friday 29th January.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or National Eating Disorder Hotline at 800-931-2237.</strong></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Billie Eilish debuts new song Therefore I Am on American Music Awards 2020</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqYmZ%2Bc4WUaJmipJyesm6xyKWgrKBdqMGivtWem2aglafAprjFZpuinaRivaq4y6xkoZmkp7KlecGom7Jn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jazmine-hood-19961007-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jazmine Hood (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
