The psychological thriller series was an immediate hit, earning <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>14 Emmy Award nominations</a>, and scored an early season 2 renewal. However, production on season 2 has been stalled amidst the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ongoing writers’ and SAG-AFTRA strikes</a> in Hollywood. The first season of Severance&nbsp;was perfect television, so the stakes are high for season 2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/severance-season-2-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Severance&nbsp;is about a group of employees at Lumon Industries whose non-work memories are “severed” from their work memories. Season 2 will pick up after the insane cliffhanger in the season 1 finale. Apple announced several new cast members, including a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Game of Thrones</a>&nbsp;alum. Here is everything you need to know about&nbsp;Severance&nbsp;season 2.</p><h2>Severance&nbsp;Season 2 Release Date</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Severance&nbsp;season 2 does not have a premiere date yet. The show was expected to return in 2024, but that could change due to the Hollywood strikes. Apple has not confirmed when&nbsp;Severance&nbsp;will be back on our screens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/severance-season-2-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Apple officially renewed the hit series created by <strong>Dan Erickson</strong> for a second season on April 6, 2022. “It’s really exciting to see the response from people who are loving the show — and the level of fan engagement,” director and executive producer <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ben Stiller</strong></a> said in a statement to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. “It has been a long road bringing ‘Severance’ to television. I first read Dan’s pilot over five years ago. It has always been a multi season story and I’m really happy we get to continue it. I’m grateful to our partners at Apple TV+ who have been behind it the whole way. Praise Kier!”</p><h2>Severance&nbsp;Season 2 Filming Details</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Filming on&nbsp;Severance&nbsp;season 2 began on October 31, 2022. Apple shared a photo of lead star&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Adam Scott</a>&nbsp;</strong>shooting a scene on set. Adam retweeted Apple’s message and wrote, “Can’t wait for everyone to see what we’re doing in S2…”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Can’t wait for everyone to see what we’re doing in S2…💧 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>https://t.co/RGGpCOEVWz</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>— Adam Scott (@mradamscott) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>October 31, 2022</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>However, the Severance&nbsp;production stopped working on season 2 when the WGA strike began in early May 2023. Two months later, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the actors also went on strike</a>, further delaying production on nearly every TV and movie production.&nbsp;Severance&nbsp;is expected to resume production once both strikes come to an end.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>There was also rumors of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>behind-the-scenes drama</a> between co-showrunners Dan Erickson and <strong>Mark Friedman</strong> which allegedly impacted season 2’s production schedule. However, Ben Stiller denied this via Twitter on April 28, 2023. “No one’s going to the break room. We’re on the same really slow schedule we’ve always been on,” Ben said. “Same target air date we’ve always had. Love our fans and each other and we all are just working to make the show as good as possible.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>No one’s going to the break room.

That includes Adam Scott as Mark Scout, <strong>Britt Lower</strong> as Helly Riggs, <strong>Zach Cherry</strong> as Dylan George, <strong>John Turturro</strong> as Irving Bailiff, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Patricia Arquette</strong></a> as Harmony Cobel, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Trammell Tillman</strong></a> as Seth Milchick, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Christopher Walken</strong></a> as Burt Goodman,<strong> Jen Tullock</strong> as Devon Scout-Hale, and <strong>Michael Chernus</strong> as Ricken Hale. <strong>Dichen Lachman&nbsp;</strong>is expected to have a bigger role as Ms. Casey, a.k.a Mark’s wife who was thought to be dead.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Apple announced the new season 2 cast members on October 31, the day filming began.

Meanwhile, Dan Erickson told&nbsp;THR&nbsp;he wants to pitch&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Barack Obama</a>&nbsp;</strong>to join the show. “I think he’d be really good, he’d bring some gravitas,” Dan said.</p><h2>Severance Season 2 Plot Details</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>The&nbsp;Severance&nbsp;team has dropped hints about what fans can expect from season 2. Creator Dan Erickson told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Esquire</a>, “There’s definitely going to be some expansion of the world. Within Lumon, we’re going to see more of the building, and we’ll see more of the outside world, too.” Dan also confirmed that he has a “overall plan” for the series. “I have an end point in mind, and I intentionally didn’t plan it season by season, because I wanted it to be flexible enough that we could get there in two seasons or six seasons,” he said. “I want to allow us to be surprised by where the show goes. There’s a sense of what Lumon is trying to do and the role that our main characters are going to play in that, and where it all will culminate.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>In a chat with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Weekly</a>, Dan said that season 2 will show “all of these people on the outside” of Lumon. “Similar to Mark, they each had their own reason for getting this procedure, and they’re all at some stage of a healing process for one thing or another,” Dan explained. “In season 2, we’re really going to expand and get into all of that. But then there’ll be plenty of office stuff too. There may even be another melon bar.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/severance-season-2-embed4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>Ben Stiller told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>&nbsp;that he feels a “responsibility” to answer questions about the show’s mysteries in the next season. “We felt that there’s a balance [to aim for], because if too many questions are answered, then you don’t have a chance to really speculate and live in the world as much,” Ben explained. “So, we’re trying to figure out how to live in that world and figure out that balance, but the answers are there. It’s just, we want to try to mete it out in a way that feels fun and satisfying.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>, Ben said that season 2 will pick up with everything that’s going on with Outie Mark and Innie Mark . “There is this growing connection between Mark and Helly happening during the season, and then on the outside, Mark is trying to get over his wife’s death — and then we’re going to find out that his wife is still alive. To put him in this position where the Innie Mark, we’re starting to root for him and Helly, but now we also want to root for Outie Mark to find his wife,” Ben said. “That’s an interesting juxtaposition and conflict we’ll explore in the second season.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Patrick Arquette warned that fans should be “very scared” for what could happen in season 2. “I think these guys have been working really hard, and come up with a lot of really creative things,” the actress told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;in January 2023. “They have a whole world in their minds. They just let us in, piece by piece, into what’s going on, but I think it will be fun and beautiful.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KerZ6qkaOwpnnSnpisp55if26BkG1va2llZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./charlie-stayt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charlie Stayt- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity">&larr;
