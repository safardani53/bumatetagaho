He didn’t look to be suited by making the running and he was coming back at the winner in the closing stages. I’m sure he’ll love the step up to 1m2f.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>Mark Johnston has predictably won this race twice in the last five years. His <strong>Communique</strong> overcame trouble to get up to win at Newmarket last month and he should go well from a helpful draw.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>Stablemate <strong>Ventura Knight</strong> – third in a Pontefract Listed contest on Sunday – is not out of it on his best form but he is vulnerable to anything less exposed.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Rock Eagle</strong> has been in good form in novice races but he does start life off in handicaps off a tough weight for what he’s achieved.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>I’m more worried about <strong>Completion</strong>. His second to <strong>Al Jellaby’s</strong> stablemate<strong> Crack On Crack On</strong> in Haydock’s Silver Bowl makes him closely matched with my fancy.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>He bombed out in the Britannia at Royal Ascot but I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see him bounce back.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Latest in horse racing</h2></p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>2.25</strong></p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>Put a ring around the Precious one in the Qatar Lillie Langtry Stakes.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>PRECIOUS RAMOTSWE</strong> looked smart when winning her first two starts of the season. It was the drop in distance – not the rise to Group 2 level – that was her undoing when third behind <strong>Horseplay</strong> in the Lancashire Oaks last month.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>That gives her a couple of lengths to find with runner-up <strong>God Given</strong> but I’m certain she’ll improve for the step up to 1m6f.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>God Given</strong> is also likely to appreciate the longer trip. She’s a thoroughly likeable filly with a good attitude and she won’t be easy to pace if getting on the lead from stall one.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Maid To Remember</strong> is another with possibilities upped half-mile in trip. She has run a couple of promising races over 1m2f this season and it’s pretty obvious she needs today’s longer trip.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>Pilaster is sure to be popular after impressive all-weather novice wins.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>There’s little doubt she has the potential to be competitive at this level but three-year-olds have not got a great record in this contest. Only subsequent St Leger heroine <strong>Simple Verse</strong> has struck for the Classic generation in the last nine years.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>That also counts against in-form <strong>Maid Up</strong>. Of the three-year-olds, I prefer <strong>Lubink</strong> and I wouldn’t be surprised to see <strong>Lady Of Shalott</strong> run a big race at tasty odds.</p><h3><a href=# rel=noopener>GLORIOUS GOODWOOD LIVE&nbsp;<span>All the latest news and tips from the track</span></a></h3><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>3.00</strong></p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>Cut the bookies down to size with <strong>SABRE</strong> in the Qatar Richmond Stakes.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>He’s narrowly come up short in Listed races since bolting up on his debut at Newcastle in the spring. That might make the step up to this Group 2 a bit of a jump but I’m not so sure.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>He struck for home a bit soon when runner-up – one place ahead of <strong>Konchek</strong> – at Sandown in May and he ran a cracker at Royal Ascot.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>His half-length second behind <strong>Soldier’s Call</strong> in the Windsor Castle is good form and there’s case to say he was at a slight disadvantage racing on the stands’ side.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>He finished the race off really well and – like his breeding suggests – he looks ready for the step up to 6f.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Konchek</strong> was a bit unlucky from a wide draw in that Sandown Listed contest before finishing fifth in the Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot. The extra furlong of the July Stakes really suited him last time when runner-up to <strong>Advertise</strong> and he looks sure to go well.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Marie’s Diamond</strong> might have gone a little under the radar having raced in Ireland since landing a Chester novice prize in June. His Curragh Group 3 success was a decent effort but he needs to take another step forward today to take a hand in the finish.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Land Force</strong> is more interesting. He was a little unlucky when third in the Norfolk having raced away from the main action.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Shine So Bright</strong> ran a big race when fifth in the Coventry at the Royal meeting considering he had come straight from a Nottingham maiden. He’s another with plenty of potential.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Templegate's Goodwood tips</h3></p><p><strong>1.50 Al Jellaby -&nbsp;</strong>smart maiden form last season and he made a cracking return in hot handicap at Ascot</p><p><strong>2.25&nbsp;Precious Ramotswe -&nbsp;</strong>has looked smart early on this season and she should lap up this trip</p><p><strong>3.00 Sabre -&nbsp;</strong>ran a cracker at Royal Ascot when drawn on the wrong side</p><p><strong>3.35 Rhododendron -&nbsp;</strong>one of the top milers around even though she was well beaten in the Queen Anne</p><p><strong>4.10 Forseti -&nbsp;</strong>This kind of contest could be right up his street and Newbury effort still hot form</p><p><strong>4.45 Lady Cosette -&nbsp;</strong>Better than last effort in hot race and should be primed for this</p><p><strong>5.20 Cowboy Soldier -&nbsp;</strong>goes well after a break so returning after a couple of months off the track is not a problem</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>3.35</strong></p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>RHODODENDRON</strong> is ready to blossom in the Qatar Nassau Stakes.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>Her last 11 races have come in Group 1 contests. She’s won 11 of them and was desperately unlucky not to win at the Breeders’ Cup.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>Her last-gasp Lockinge defeat of<strong> Lightning Spear</strong> makes her one of the top milers around even though she was well beaten in the Queen Anne when getting involved too early.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>Both those races were over a mile and I’m convinced today’s longer distance is her best trip. She one over it on Arc day in France last season having chased home enable over 1m4f in the Oaks earlier in the season.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Urban Fox</strong> is a fascinating rival. She had a stack of chances in Group races when trained by James Tate.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>The switch to William Haggas seems to have worked the oracle as she ran away with the Group 1 Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh last month. On that form she has to be a danger.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>It was a big ask for <strong>Veracious</strong> to jump into a Group 1 straight from an impressive maiden win. She was far from disgraced when third behind <strong>Alpha Centauri</strong> – in my opinion the best miler in Europe – in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. The step up in trip is a positive and she looks to have a big future.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Billesdon Brook</strong> was a place behind <strong>Veracious</strong> at Ascot. She probably had her day when a shock winner of the 1000 Guineas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000424167749.jpg><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>4.10</strong></p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>Have a bit of For play in this nursery handicap.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>FORSETI</strong> bombed out big style in the Superlative Stakes at Newmarket’s July Meeting. That doesn’t worry me as it was a Group 2 and, more importantly, he was way to keen in the small-field race.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>His debut fourth behind <strong>Confiding</strong> in a red-hot Newbury maiden and his narrow Salisbury success were better measures of his true ability. This kind of contest could be right up his street.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>This is another race Mark Johnston has a good record in having lifted the pot twice in the last four years. <strong>His Cupboard Love</strong> has claims after a brace of Haydock wins but stall 16 is not going to be easy to overcome.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>No More Regrets, Two Blondes</strong> and <strong>James Watt</strong> are others who have been done no favours in the draw.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>Unbeaten <strong>More Than This</strong> has an obvious chance. He looked smart when winning at Ayr and Haydock but he has shown his hand more than most.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Mohogany</strong> would be an interesting outsider if turning up two days after finishing fifth in a Yarmouth novice race. He’s got handicaps in him and under-rated jockey Noel Garbutt is great value for his 3lbs claim.</p><h3><a href=# rel=noopener>GLORIOUS GOODWOOD LIVE&nbsp;<span>All the latest news and tips from the track</span></a></h3><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>4.45</strong></p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>GET cosy with<strong> LADY COSETTE.</strong></p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>She didn’t get much room when it mattered on her debut at Newmarket. The bare form of that contest dominated by more experienced fillies from top yards is good and I reckon she’s a fair bit better than that.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Wingreen</strong> was well beaten in that race but she did blow the start. Keep an eye on her.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Accordance</strong> made a decent debut when runner-up behind smart prospect <strong>Zofelle</strong> at Doncaster. She’s one of the more likely winners.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>Her trainer Mark Johnston also runs unraced <strong>Stellar Comet</strong>. Ryan Moore is an eye-catching jockey booking for her.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Mehdaayih, Incharge</strong> and <strong>Black Medick</strong> are others making their debuts who have to be of some interest.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>5.20</strong></p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>COWBOY SOLDIER</strong> should win this shoot-out.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>He goes well after a break so returning after a couple of months off the track is not a problem. His last run was also rather good.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing>He stormed home to nail <strong>Koditime</strong> – winner of a good York handicap on his previous start – at Windsor in May. This test of speed looks right up his street.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Lord Riddiford</strong> interests me. Fast ground looks important to him so the drying conditions should be ideal. He followed a nice Windsor success by making all the running at Chelmsford and it’s hard to think he’s not improving.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Kick On Kick On</strong> is another Windsor going the right way. The 5lbs rise he copped for last month’s winning return was certainly not harsh but this race might just come a bit soon.</p><p class=m_-4101755432684087640gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>Dragon Moon</strong> might well be suited by the drop to 5f for the first time. His young jockey Thore Hammer Hansen takes off a valuable 7lbs and has impressed me this season.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Charlie Fellowes has his sights set on Cup glory with Prince Of Arran</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLWwvtKeqZqbmaO0cIKXcG9vcGRktK270aKmrqtdnLywsNaopp1lpJ69tHnTnqSppJWcrrWxjGtm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./robert-grant-18520124-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robert Grant (Novelist) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
