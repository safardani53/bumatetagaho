"Her family and friends are devastated and have requested privacy at this very difficult time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The singer — who broke through in 1990 with her No. 1 hit "Nothing Compares 2 U," a song written and composed by Prince — was the mother of four children, including her late son Shane O'Connor, who died at age 17 in 2022.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Andrew Chin/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though she dealt with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>several personal struggles in her life</a>, including an abusive relationship with her mother as a child and mental health struggles, she was incredibly proud of her children. She primarily kept them out of the spotlight, but in 2021, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>O'Connor spoke fondly of them with PEOPLE</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s everything to know about her four children.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jake-reynolds></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Jake Reynolds&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">O'Connor welcomed her first child, son Jake Reynolds, in 1987 with music producer John Reynolds. In 2015, Jake and his girlfriend Lia welcomed their first child, a baby boy, making O'Connor a grandmother.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, O'Connor excitedly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>announced the news on Facebook</a>, posting a cartoon that spelled out, "It's a boy,” alongside the caption: "Don't mess with abuelita."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking with PEOPLE in 2021, O'Connor said that “I see [my children] as much as they want to see me,” which had become less frequent with her adult children lately “because they're just so busy themselves with their children.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also revealed that her two eldest are in the food services profession: Jake is a chef, and Roisin is a pastry chef.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-roisin-waters></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Roisin Waters&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1995, O'Connor welcomed her first and only daughter Roisin, whom she shares with journalist John Waters. Following her birth, O'Connor and Waters went through a lengthy custody battle; after O'Connor attempted suicide, she gave custody of Roisin to Waters, as<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> MTV News reported in 1999</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2014, Roisin made a rare public appearance with her mother when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>the two performed a duet</a> on Icelandic TV.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite having a “great singing voice,” O'Connor told PEOPLE in 2021, she was relieved her daughter decided to be a pastry chef instead of going into the music industry. “I used to be frightened of her getting into the music business because I thought they would treat her like they treat me,” she explained. “I didn't want that.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shane-lunny></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shane Lunny&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2004, O'Connor welcomed her third child, a son named Shane Lunny, with Irish singer Donal Lunny. Speaking with PEOPLE in 2021, she called Shane “a real mommy's boy ... He just loves his mommy since the day he was born."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the interview, O'Connor added of her then-teenage son that he was less focused on going to college, instead hoping to be follow in his mom's footsteps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He's the one of them that keeps saying he wants to be a musician,” she said. “He's a brilliant wordsmith. When he was 8, he was sent to a particular organization that assessed his intellect, and they said that in his use of vocabulary, he was the age 16. He's a master of English. So he wants to be a rapper in particular, which I'd say he'd be great at because he's a brilliant wordsmith.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following year, O'Connor dealt with a major tragedy as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Shane died by suicide at age 17</a> in January 2022, a week after going missing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My beautiful son, Nevi'im Nesta Ali Shane O'Connor, the very light of my life, decided to end his earthly struggle today and is now with God," she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>tweeted</a> at the time. "May he rest in peace and may no one follow his example. My baby. I love you so much. Please be at peace."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a follow-up post, the "Nothing Compares to You" singer tweeted a Bob Marley song, which she dedicated to Shane. "This is for my Shaney. The light of my life. The lamp of my soul. My blue-eye baby," she wrote. "You will always be my light. We will always be together. No boundary can separate us."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shortly before O'Connor's own death in 2023, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she posted another tribute to her son</a>. "Been&nbsp;living as undead&nbsp;night creature since," his death, she wrote on Twitter. "He was the&nbsp;love of my life, the&nbsp;lamp of my soul.&nbsp;We were one soul in two halves. He was the only person&nbsp;who ever loved me unconditionally.

She shares Yeshua with Frank Bonadio. In 2021, O'Connor spoke about Yeshua’s interests, noting he was also an “incredible musician ... [He] plays piano and everything incredibly and an incredible singing voice.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, she noted that Yeshua “could do anything” career-wise. “He's half American, so he's interested in going to college in America,” she said at the time. “His father is a scientist. So we'll see. But I would not be surprised if he got into music, because he likes money.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5GhuW6twaisrWWjnrumrcNmpmabn6O7sL6MnJ%2BipJSnsq95lm5tb2hgaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./super-bowl-2023-photos-highlights.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photos Of The Biggest Moments  Hollywood Life">&larr;
