"To have Derek come into rehearsals, that's like Beyoncé giving you vocal lessons," Ariana joked to cameras.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Derek advised Ariana and Pasha to focus on their arm placement and keeping their feet closed. "In order to redeem myself, I have to be a perfect dancer," Ariana vowed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After their dance, the crowd was on their feet — and it appeared Ariana even had another special guest in the audience: fellow VPR star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Katie Maloney</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Derek praised Ariana, calling her the "Samba queen," and commended her for doing the "difficult" routine "effortlessly."

Carrie Ann was also proud of the "refinement" she made in the moves, but noted that she "got a little ahead of the music."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the judges' feedback, Ariana said she was simply thrilled to be able to say she danced with Derek Hough.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Score: 29/30<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Charity Lawson and Artem Chigvintsev</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Charity said making it to the DWTS finale was "the best feeling" aside from getting engaged to her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bachelorette</a> finalist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Dotun Olubeko</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's so exciting to say I made it and I'm here," she said as she reflected on her up-and-down journey on the show, which often included receiving constructive criticism from the judges.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie Ann entered their rehearsal session, assigning the duo a Tango to “Libertango” by Astor Piazzolla.&nbsp;As Charity listened to her feedback and applied it into their routine, she told cameras, "I am taking every single bit of her advice because it's the finale, it's now or never."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After their dance, Carrie Ann called the routine "amazing" and praised the "connection" between Charity and Artem. She did, however, point out a mistake in their dance. Derek was on his feet and called the routine "the best dance of the night so far," calling it "captivating," "fierce" and "so strong."

"Being here and making it this far, it's pretty unbelievable and I'm really grateful," she told cameras.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Bruno arrived in rehearsals, he told Xochitl and Val they'd be dancing a redemption Foxtrot to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Katy Perry</a>’s “Unconditionally.” Xochitl vowed to take Bruno's advice and "make him proud" — while also achieving a perfect score.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-96 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Anything lower than a 10 is gonna be a little bit scary," she said of the importance that the finale dances hold.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the routine, Bruno commended Xochitl's "musicality" and said "it is a delight watching you." Carrie Ann called the dance "breathtakingly beautiful" and pointed out how effortlessly she makes dancing look. Derek said it was "smooth as silk" and Xochitl should be "so proud" of herself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-100 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though she was fearful of not receiving a 10, Xochitl's fears appeared to be unfounded as she earned a perfect score for her first dance of the evening.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Score: 30/30<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-second-round-freestyle></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>SECOND ROUND: FREESTYLE</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-109 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Heading into the freestyle round, Xochitl and Val topped the leaderboard with a 90/90 (their redemption round score plus their scores from last week) while Alyson and Sasha sat at the bottom with 76/90.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-111 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Charity Lawson and Artem Chigvintsev</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-112 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Charity teared up in rehearsals as she anticipated dancing her final dance on DWTS. "It's been so rewarding seeing myself change over the course of time," she told Artem.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-114 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For her freestyle, Charity decided to incorporate cheerleading into the routine since she cheered when she was younger. "I am among the best of the best so I have to do something extra to stand out," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-116 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, in rehearsals, Charity <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>suffered a jaw injury</a> that ultimately sent her to the hospital in an ambulance. Charity feared she wouldn't be able to open her mouth, but ultimately returned after confirming there were no breaks or serious injuries. "Nothing is gonna stop me from bringing home the mirrorball," she vowed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-120 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her high-energy performance — complete with flips, throws and cartwheels to “Lose My Breath” by&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Destiny’s Child</a>&nbsp;and “Suéltate” by Sam i & Jarina De Marco featuring Anitta & BIA – had the audience on their feet and the judges raving afterwards.

For the freestyle round, Jason chose “Happy” by C2C featuring Derek Martin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-133 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He said the song was a perfect fit because it was about choosing to "face your fears and find your happiness, and that's been my journey on this show." He also said he can't believe how much he's grown, noting, "When I look back at some of the dances, I can't believe it's me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-135 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite performing the "most intense routine that I've ever had to pull off," Jason vowed to nail the dance. "I'm not that kid who gives up anymore," he said, noting he would "dance without fear of being judged."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-137 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I fought my way into this finale," he added.
