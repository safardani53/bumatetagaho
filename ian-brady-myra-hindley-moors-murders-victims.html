his perfect murder” when he spotted 16-year-old <a href=#>Pauline Reade</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Hindley</a> asked her if she would help her locate an expensive glove she had lost on the Moor.</p><p>She later claimed <a href=#>Brady</a> then took <a href=#>Pauline</a> on to the Moor, where he slashed her throat twice and sexually assaulted her.</p><p>Brady claims that Hindley helped.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">READ MORE ON IAN BRADY</h2></p><p>It was only 19 years after he was caged for life over his sickening crimes that Brady confessed to Pauline's murder.</p><p>On June 30, 1987, after 100 days of searching, the body of <a href=#>Pauline</a> was found buried three feet below the ground.</p><p>It took pathologists a month to decide that the girl had been sexually assaulted and her throat slashed from behind.</p><h3>John Kilbride</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

assaulted him before strangling on November 23, 1963, Hindley approached <a href=#>John Kilbride</a> in Ashton-under-Lyne, <a href=#>Lancashire</a>, and offered him a lift home.</p><p>Brady told the 12-year-old he would give him some sherry, but they would have to make a detour on the Moor first.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">read more on serial killers</h2></p><p>He sexually assaulted the youngster and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string.</p><p><a href=#>John</a> was found buried on the Moors on October 21, 1965, two years after he went missing.</p><h3>Keith Bennett</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000000566969.jpg><p><a href=#>Keith Bennett</a>, 12, was on his way to his grandmother’s house on June 16, 1964, when Hindley lured him into her van.</p><p>She drove to a lay-by on the Moor and Brady took the boy while Hindley kept watch.</p><p>Brady reappeared 30 minutes later having sexually assaulted and strangled Keith.</p><p>After he was transferred from <a href=#>prison to maximum-security hospital Ashworth</a> in November 1985, Brady confessed to Keith's murder in an interview with reporters.</p><p>A search was carried out on the moors a year later, with Hindley joining officers in 1986 and Brady in 1987.</p><p>But <a href=#>Keith's body was never found</a> and it is now a secret <a href=#>Brady has taken to the grave</a>.</p><p>A fresh search was<a href=#> launched in September 2022</a> after a <a href=#>child's skull was reported</a> to have been

on Boxing Day, 1964, and came across <a href=#>Lesley Ann Downey</a>.</p><p>They approached the 10-year-old and lured her back to their house, where she was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed.</p><p>The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey’s body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at her feet, in a shallow grave.</p><p>Her naked body was not found until October 10, 1965.</p><p>At their trial in 1966, all-male jurors fell silent for 16 minutes as the <a href=#>tape recording</a> of Lesley Ann Downey’s terrified last moments was played to the court.</p><p>The tape was played at full volume and the chilling sounds of screaming echoed through the court before only the footsteps and soft voices in the background could be heard.</p><p>Harrowing passages could be heard including “Don’t undress me, will you?” and “I want to see mummy”. The haunting sound of the 10-year-old’s throat being slit was also played to the court.</p><h3>Edward Evans</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000019128807.jpg><p>The monster couple might have gone on to murder more had it not been for a blunder involving 17-year-old Edward.</p><p>On October 6, 1965, Brady met 17-year-old apprentice engineer <a href=#>Edward Evans</a> at <a href=#>Manchester</a> Central railway station and invited him to his home.</p><p>At this point, Brady and Hindley had become intent on corrupting <a href=#>Myra’s brother-in-law, David Smith,</a> and recruiting him into their twisted circle where Brady would talk about murder.</p><p>Brady offered a practical demonstration with Edward - striking him fourteen times with a hatchet before finishing the job by strangling him.</p><p>Horrified, Smith phoned police the next morning and directed them to Brady’s address.</p><p>Officers searched 16 Wardle Brook Avenue where they discovered Edward’s corpse wrapped in plastic sheeting.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Read More in The Sun</h2></p><p>The bloody murder weapon was also recovered, along with Brady’s collection of books on perversion and sadism.</p><p>Brady and Hindley's gruesome reign of terror began to unravel and the twisted pair were arrested on suspicion of murder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfaIJ4fZFsaWihkaN6o77AnbBmpamnrm60yKebpZ2pYrqwu9GsZKatopmys7%2BMr6CcrJmiwHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cameron-canela-wcj1-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cameron Canela (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
