Rose has also deleted all of the proof of their romance from her social media, as she event went completely dark shortly after their breakup. She returned to Instagram in July 2021, about one year after she and Zach had gotten married. “she’s ba—ack ;-),” she captioned the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>solo photo</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Zach confirmed that he and Rose had tied the knot via Twitter on Aug. 18, 2020. When a fan shared <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a meme</a> asking the musician for new merch, he responded by noting that he was busy with more important matters. “ya sorry brother had to get married that’s my bad,” Zach tweeted at the time. And although the ex love birds have deleted each other’s trace from their social media, the photographer that took photos of their wedding still has the snapshots on their official Facebook page (see <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PHOTOS HERE</a>).</p><h2>What Fans Have Said About Their Divorce</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>One year after their wedding, the pair had decided to go their<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> separate ways</a>.

The two were not shy about their romance and have featured each other on their respective accounts. Zach often made many appearances on Debbie’s TikTok account, including a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video</a> from Oct. 2022, where Zach sang about losing his voice. “We’re on our way home!
