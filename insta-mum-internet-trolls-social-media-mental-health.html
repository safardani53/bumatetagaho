I was standing outside Tottenham Court Road Tube station, but I could have been anywhere, because I was <a href=#>immersed in the online world of Instagram</a> – where someone had said they thought my kid’s hair was s**t.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Anna-Whitehouse-Photo-Credit-Emily-Gray-2.jpg><p>In that moment, I chose to engage with a stranger on the internet instead of my then 18-month-old daughter. That was in October 2015 and it was my first pull of obsession with what strangers thought of me online.</p><p>I had 4,000 <a href=#>Instagram followers</a> back then, and I now have 230,000 – many who don’t agree with or even like me. While my main income comes from <a href=#>being a Heart Radio presenter</a>, I’ve also become an influencer. I influence people with my thoughts and with brand partnerships.</p><p>My Instagram account didn’t set out to make money, it began out of frustration. Most of the media seemed uninterested in features about what it was really like to be a mum and I wanted to write about leaking boobs and offer respite from the <a href=#>breast vs bottle</a> debates.</p><p>The positives have been huge. I’ve been able to launch Flex Appeal – a campaign for flexible working for all, which has helped get a bill read in <a href=#>parliament</a>, requiring bosses to offer flexible working in employment contracts and advertise job vacancies as suitable for flexible working.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Anna-Whitehouse-7_bw.jpg><p>But I’m aware I’ve pulled my family into this and my paranoia deepened with fears that it wouldn’t just be my children’s hair that would attract criticism. I’m not a celebrity and, yet, I am in the public eye and there is little protection from social media giants for anyone navigating this new digital world.</p><p>And there has been a darker side for me, too. I joined <a href=#>Mumsnet</a> as @badmotherpukka in October 2017 to talk – as myself – to those criticising me. I’d direct message those hurling the rocks in a bid to soften the blows.</p><p>I’d find myself checking for updates under the dinner table, waiting for the next attack. I’d be called a “virtue-signalling c**t” by anonymous accounts on Instagram and told I was selling my children on the net. I stopped engaging with friends in real life and I started living online.</p><p>I was answering my critics with one hand and holding my breastfeeding newborn with the other. Looking back, I was in the fug of postnatal depression and should have prioritised my mind, not the algorithm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Anna-Whitehouse-1.jpg><p>The turning point was when my eldest daughter said: “Mummy, sometimes I don’t think you like me when you’re on your phone.” That was a wake-up call. I stopped posting about my kids, I stopped speaking as openly. I stopped taking photos for fear of missing the moment.</p><p>None of this was to shame anyone doing those things, it was simply to protect my fast-unravelling mind. So how do I deal with the downsides now? While I can’t stand trolling – someone who actively tries to hurt an individual with inflammatory comments – I do accept differences of opinion.</p><p>Blocking, for me, is a last resort. <a href=#>It’s for trolls who are deliberately abusive</a> and who I believe should face prosecution. I don’t believe blocking should be used for simply disagreeing. It also leads to internet forums like Tattle Life – a place where those who’ve been shut out are welcomed.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p>There’s a petition to close down Tattle Life, but that’s not going to fix the problem. If one closes, another will pop up because people’s desire to gossip won’t fade. What has changed for me is communicating more on LinkedIn, where there’s no anonymity and users are held accountable for their words.</p><p>Under the veil of anonymity, anyone can say anything without repercussion. Times have changed, so regulation must change, before someone trying to break the internet gets broken by it.</p><p>I don’t expect us all to get along, but I think it’s fair to see who we’re speaking to. We’re only human, after all.</p><ul><li><strong>Where’s My Happy Ending? by Anna Whitehouse and Matt Farquharson (£14.99, Bluebird) is out on February 6.
