In case you have never made use of this tube, it is high time to start using it. It's crucial to know the method of oiling clippers so that your investment does not go to waste.</span></p><h3><span>The Method of Oiling Hair Clippers</span></h3><p><span>Similar to a vehicle, even hair clippers demand usual servicing. This allows them to function properly. Therefore, just like you take your car for an oil change, you should offer your clippers a fresh coat of oil on a frequent basis.</span></p><p><span>It is worth considering that if the hair clippers are not oiled well, they will become blunt way earlier than you know it. Then, it will become too difficult to use them.</span></p><p><span>So, let's go over some critical steps that will guide you through the clipper oiling process.</span></p><h4><span>Step 1</span></h4><p><span>Prior to the application of the clipper lubricating oil, the blade needs to be cleaned perfectly. There is no use of oiling if the blade is messy or hairy.</span></p><p><span>Hence, it would be ideal for you to spray a cleaner on the hair clipper and then utilize the brush that came with your clipper to clean the surface of the blades. You should also wipe it with a towel if needed.</span></p><h4><span>Step 2</span></h4><p><span>Generally, a lot of individuals tend to make the terrible mistake of not turning on the hair clippers prior to applying the oil. You should never forget this step. Irrespective of the quality of the clipper lubricating oil, it can only penetrate when the machine is turned on.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, to make sure that the oil penetrates deeply into the blades, you should apply the oil in the center of the blade rather than on the top and sides.</span></p><h4><span>Step 3</span></h4><p><span>Typically, experts suggest running the clipper for 20 seconds maximum. This will enable a complete penetration of the oil prior to turning the clipper off.</span></p><p><span>If you want to spot excess oil, it is critical to wipe it off by using a towel. If this step is skipped, it will cling to the pet's or your hair and make a mess.</span></p><h3><span>Things to Look for in a Hair Clipper Oil</span></h3><p><span>Hair clipper oils often use the same formula with only a slight change of ingredients. Hence it is futile to look for ingredients specifically; rather, we should aim to focus on other aspects of the product. Some important things are:</span></p><h4><span>Packaging</span></h4><p><span>The packaging of the hair clipper oil needs to be convenient and well made. You do not want the oil to leak as it can easily stain clothes and surfaces. These oils usually come in the form of bottles hence the cap should fit well and the bottle should be easy to hold.</span></p><h4><span>Application</span></h4><p><span>Application is another important thing to take into consideration. Most hair clipper oil bottles have elongated nozzles to aid with the application of the oil onto the blades. You should opt for a product that has a thin nozzle that can easily get into small places. Never attempt to spread out hair clipper oil with your finger, use a cotton swab instead.</span></p><h4><span>Purpose of use</span></h4><p><span>Some blade clipper oils have multiple uses that make them very convenient for the owner. In some cases, the blade oil can be used to clean screens as well. It can also be used to oil other grooming tools such as dual-blade razors or nail cutters. Therefore, choose an oil that works on most treated metals so you can make the most of it.</span></p><h3><span>Why is it Important to Invest in Hair Clipper Lubricating Oils?</span></h3><p><span>Investing in hair clipper oils&nbsp; is important for the following reasons:</span></p><ul><li><span>The hair clippers increase in efficiency if they are oiled regularly.</span></li><li><span>The continuous usage of hair clipper lubricating oil reduces the friction between the blades, which is the biggest cause of the objectâ€™s short life.</span></li><li><span>Some groomers use the oil for honing, pre-soaking, and sharpening clipper blades. This makes the tasks very simple.</span></li><li><span>It can save tons of time.</span></li><li><span>Lastly, properly oiled hair clipper blades tend to rust or corrode much slower due to the protective layer on the top.</span></li></ul><h3><span>The Oils that Should Be Avoided at All Times</span></h3><p><span>Do not give attention to any tips, hacks, or tricks that recommend employing any of the heavy viscosity oils. Below are some of the high viscosity lubricants or oils to always avoid and never apply on clippers:</span></p><ul><li><span>Extra virgin olive oil</span></li><li><span>WD-40</span></li><li><span>Pure olive oil</span></li><li><span>Other heavy lubricants or oils</span></li></ul><p><span>High viscosity oils are highly dangerous for tools as they immediately make the clipper dysfunctional. This category of oils is manufactured for big mechanical devices instead of small machine parts, such as clippers or trimmers. Always utilize thin and light oils, or particularly, clipper specialized oils, and stay away from other thicker alternatives.</span></p><h3><span>A Pro Tip</span></h3><p><span>If there's a clipper that hasn't been utilized in a long time, make sure to lubricate it properly before using it. With the passage of time, there remains no lubrication. This can lead to an accident.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Conclusion</span></h3><p><span>This brings us to the end of our guide on oiling the hair clipper to extend its lifetime and optimum performance. It might appear to be a hassle, but it is an important step for boosting the longevity and safety of the device. Following a cleaning method will guarantee a gratifying clipping experience each time you utilize the tool.</span></p><p><span>Now that you know the oiling method, and which oils to avoid, you are perfectly prepared for a superb maintenance routine for getting the best trim or haircut.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwvMSrqqimkaF6pK3RnmahmZmneqS4yKmnnqpdpLatew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./holly-madison-pics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Holly Madison  Pics Of Former Playboy Model  Hollywood Life">&larr;
