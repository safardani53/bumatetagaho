We’ve just started. It’s a very big project, so we’re getting to know each other. They’re lovely people. It’s great, but I can’t tell you too much. I can’t tell you really anything about the story!

HotD is all I hoped it would be; dark, powerful, visceral, disturbing, stunning to look at, peopled with complex and very human characters brought to life by some truly amazing actors,” he wrote.</p><h2>Storyline</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>The first teaser for House of the Dragon was unveiled on October 5. The show takes place 200 years before Game of Thrones when the Targaryen dynasty reigned. Fire & Blood, the book on which the show is based, encompasses Targaryen history from Aegon the Conqueror to Aegon III. The show will prominently feature The Dance of the Dragons, a civil war that nearly destroyed Westeros.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-12><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The official trailer</a> was released in July 2022. The subject of succession is at the heart of the series. While Princess Rhaenyra should be the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, her legitimacy is questioned because she is a woman. Prince Daemon Targaryen, the king’s brother, is also a major candidate. “I will not be made to choose between my brother and my daughter,” King Viserys I says.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“When I am queen, I will create a new order,” Rhaenyra vows. As the battle for the Iron Throne becomes more precarious as the years go on, people will have to choose sides. Alicent Hightower, the king’s second wife, believes that if Rhaenyra comes into power she can “cut off any challenge to her succession.” To make things even dicier, there are lots and lots of dragons.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Just days before the show’s premiere, HBO released a final “Fire Will Reign” promo. The threat of war looms over everyone in Westeros. “We are better defended… by whomever may dare to challenge us,” Viserys says. The quest for power clearly runs in the Targaryen family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8eorKydXaSzbsDHnmSdqpGcvK95wpqqrWVkZ4F4hJNwZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./musiq-soulchilds-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Musiq Soulchild Dating  Musiq Soulchild's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes">&larr;
